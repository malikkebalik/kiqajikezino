Sunrise and sunset are the most important periods of the day during which a human body can safely get solar energy without any harm.</p><p>That is the reason why on third and fourth, devotees make offering when the sun is just setting and just rising, respectively.</p><p>During this period the solar energy has a low level of ultraviolet radiations so it is safe for the human body.</p><p>The ritual of Chhath puja provides mental calmness (by detoxifying the body and mind), enhances the energy level and immunity reduces the frequency of anger, jealous as well as a lot of negative emotions.</p><p>It is also believed that following the Chhath processes helps in slowing down the aging process.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel=noopener>Why Diwali is celebrated?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilqam1qMXAmqVnm5%2BifKS0x5qroWWgqreiecScpmaeop6yr7DLsmSfnaOptrety2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-it-is-celebrated-significance-history-importance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-it-is-celebrated-significance-history-importance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-it-is-celebrated-significance-history-importance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-it-is-celebrated-significance-history-importance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-it-is-celebrated-significance-history-importance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-it-is-celebrated-significance-history-importance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wiki-bio-net-worth-wife-kids-family-gun-scare.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wiki-bio-net-worth-wife-kids-family-gun-scare.html>Wiki-Bio, net worth, wife, kids, family, gun scare.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./twenty-one-pilots-singer-tyler-joseph-celebrates-the-arrival-of-his-second-child.html>Twenty One Pilots singer Tyler Joseph celebrates the arrival of his second child</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./twenty-one-pilots-singer-tyler-joseph-celebrates-the-arrival-of-his-second-child.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
