Baier, who used to be an altar boy, is a devout Roman Catholic who worships at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown. He used to be the network's Chief White House Correspondent and Pentagon Correspondent.</p><p><span class=plag_find data-countername=plag_match_counter1>The journalist was born in Rumson, New Jersey, to a mixed German and Irish family.</span> He was raised Catholic and graduated in 1988 from Marist School in Atlanta, Georgia, a private Roman Catholic secondary school.

Many people wonder how he managed to maintain his youthful appearance in his early 50s. He's surrounded by rumors as a well-known anchor, and the bulk of the public's gaze is drawn to him every day. For him, every change has become a source of fear.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=15>Many people have had plastic surgery as they become older because they are frightened of having aged and wrinkled faces. Based on his appearance, Bret appears to have the same goal.</p><p data-changed=false data-paragraphid=15>Although the particular procedures performed on the Fox anchor's face are unknown, he may have had Botox and fillers. These procedures are quite widespread in the media industry.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=16><span class=blue-complex-underline data-startindex=0 data-endindex=116 data-paragraphid=16>However, based only on the photographs, it's reasonable to assume that the 52-year-old has undergone plastic surgery.
