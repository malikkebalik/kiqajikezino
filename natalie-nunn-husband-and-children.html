She saw her parents, Karen and Earl Nunn, in Concord, California, as she opened her eyes. She is of Caucasian ethnicity and is a native of the United States.</p><p>Despite being born in Concord, she and her mother eventually relocated to Pleasanton. Alongside her brother Ronald Nunn, Natalie spent the majority of her early years there. In the past, her mother worked two jobs to support her and her sibling. But neither the nature of the work nor her father’s occupation are known.</p><h2><span id=How_Old_Is_She>How Old Is She?</span></h2><p>Natalie Nunn will be 38 years old in 2022.</p><h2><span id=Education_The_Baddies_Star_Participated_in_University_Soccer>Education: The Baddies Star Participated in University Soccer</span></h2><p>Nunn had a lifelong interest in sports growing up. She attended Aragon High School in San Mateo, where she was involved in ECAs. She even won the title of most valuable player there during her final session. In addition, the reality star participated in the Junior Olympics in 2002 while running for the track squad.</p><p>Following her high school graduation, she went to the University of Southern California. She was a member of the Trojans women’s soccer team and attended on a full soccer scholarship. In addition, she was a member of the De Anza Force soccer team, which won the 2003 state title.</p><h2><span id=Natalie_Nunn_and_her_husband_fell_in_love_at_first_sight>Natalie Nunn and her husband fell in love at first sight.</span></h2><p>Nunn is wed to professional American football player Jacob Payne at the moment. The pair got together at a Detroit bar in 2011 when she was doing promotional work for her performance. Meanwhile, the club promoter and her now-husband were already present, along with his pals.</p><p>The football player caught the Bad Girl’s eye and she fell in love with him right away. It turns out that the fire wasn’t limited to one side; Payne was drawn to her when he sensed the heat. Despite residing in separate places, the two were quickly dating.</p><p>However, it appears that he was unable to keep her at bay for very long. That’s the reason that, after dating her for a few months, her ex-boyfriend Jacob traveled to Los Angeles to see her. Still, he never went and remained in her life indefinitely.</p><p>The 38-year-old stated in an interview:</p><p>He was so attractive and personable that I fell in love right away. After that, he visited me in Los Angeles and never returned.</p><h2><span id=Star_of_the_Bad_Girls_Club_Reality_TV_Broadcast_Natalie8217s_Wedding>Star of the Bad Girls Club Reality TV Broadcast Natalie’s Wedding</span></h2><p>After they had been dating for eight months, Jacob eventually got down on one knee and asked his sweetheart to marry him. Nunn and Payne were then vacationing in Negril, on the island of Jamaica. On May 5, 2012, the couple made the decision to tie the knot.</p><p>Despite being married in a sophisticated private ceremony at a friend’s estate in Topanga Canyon, California, the TV actress and her spouse’s wedding was later broadcast on television. About fifty to sixty of their friends and family members attended the event.</p><p>Later, after being accused of staging her nuptials, she appeared on three episodes of We TV’s “Bridezillas” using footage from her wedding. She explained that she didn’t want to prove anything to anyone, but rather to share her experience with her admirers.</p><h2><span id=Was_Natalie_Nunn_a_Mother_She_Had_A_Loss_of_Fertility>Was Natalie Nunn a Mother? She Had A Loss of Fertility</span></h2><p>Yes, Natalie and her husband have a lovely daughter named Journey Ruth Payne. On November 22, 2016, at five months pregnant, she shared on Instagram that she was expecting a girl. In the end, on April 16, 2017, she gave birth to a healthy child. It wasn’t simple for her, though.</p><p>Natalie Nunn with her husband and daughter Journey Ruth Payne and her husband Jacob Payne</p><p>In November of 2014, she announced her pregnancy before she ever got pregnant. But since she was leading a regular life and there was no new information regarding her pregnancy, many assumed it was all publicity stunt.</p><p>In the meantime, the single mother dispelled the allegations by discussing her miscarriage in an interview with Oxygen. She actually experienced weight gain and despair. She didn’t want to discuss it because it was a painful event and she wanted to keep it secret.</p><h2><span id=Her_Failing_Marriage_Did_She_Steal_From_Jacob_Payne>Her Failing Marriage: Did She Steal From Jacob Payne?</span></h2><p>Indeed, Natalie’s marriage has its ups and downs, just like any other. The couple’s marriage crumbled in 2019 after it was widely reported in the media that Bad Girl had cheated on her husband.</p><p>She was accused of being in a romantic relationship with Dan Osbourne and Chloe Ayling, her co-stars on Celebrity Big Brother. Following a wild evening of drinking in London in 2018, Chloe herself acknowledged being a part of the sex act. She said in an interview with The Sun:</p><p>Dan had an affair with Jacqueline by using Natalie and me. After drinking a lot, there was a threesome. In front of me, he engaged in full-length sexual activity with Natalie in the restroom, after which he kissed and made out with me.</p><p>Jacob announced that he would end their relationship until he discovered the truth after learning about the incident. On December 6, 2019, he was spotted packing up his belongings and departing the house. As a result, he was seen by himself in London without his wedding band.</p><p>But during that week, the pair was once more spotted together on London’s streets. Perhaps they had made amends and were returning.</p><p>Natalie Nunn and her spouse attended a marriage boot camp, and the bad girl said she would never be a good girl.</p><p>The reality TV personality attended the Marriage Boot Camp with her spouse in an attempt to mend their marriage, as she is doing everything in her power to keep her marriage together.
