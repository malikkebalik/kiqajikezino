He touches on subjects such as Italian American culture, marriage, everyday life, as well as pop culture.</p><p>His incredible stand-up routines have got him featured in Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days and 30 Nights, Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show, and The Late Show with Craig Ferguson. What’s more? The father of two has also appeared in and voiced characters in no less than six, well-received films. Some of the famous films he has been in include Green Book (2018) and The Irishman (2019). His backstory is yet another proof of how hard work and tenacity can help one not only monetize their passion but build lasting wealth from it.</p><h2><strong>Sebastian Maniscalco Earned A Meagre Pay At The Start of His Comedy Career<br></strong></h2><p>Sebastian Maniscalco was born Sebastian Joseph Maniscalco on July 8, 1973, in Arlington Heights, Chicago, Illinois; to parents who immigrated to the United States for their slice of the American dream. They would eventually work to able to make a decent living in the states but it was not without some period of difficulty. His father Salvatore Maniscalco worked as a hairdresser while his mother was a homemaker, together they raised young Sebastian as a Roman Catholic; he even served as an altar boy at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Mount Prospect, Illinois which explains his clean and decent comedy.</p><p>The future ace comedian schooled at&nbsp;Rolling Meadows High School after which he proceeded to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in communications studies. Rather than opt for a regular corporate job, Maniscalco knew what he wanted – comedy and was ready to pursue it with all of his might. Fresh from college, Maniscalco moved to Los Angeles in 1998 in a bid to make his dreams come alive. He began performing at open mics in bars and bowling alleys while moonlighting as a waiter at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.</p><p>He would do this for the next seven years, a period that Maniscalco got to learn a lot about people’s behaviors while serving them, he often draws inspiration from his experience during this time to create his material. Though it was difficult the condescending way he was treated by customers, he kept the job because it paid the bills, put food on his table, and above all helped him to keep chasing his comedy career.</p><p>Those early years were difficult as the comedian has come to reveal. He would even dash out during his breaks/in the middle of shifts to perform stand-up comedy at the Comedy Store and return just in time before his next shift. Alternating jobs as a waiter and stand-up comedian was hectic, regardless, Maniscalco never said no to a gig. No matter how small the pay was, he would take it and show up. At some point, he added another side job selling satellite dishes at a mall kiosk. His mother was even at some point worried and once asked him when he planned on stopping, to which he replied that he would fail if he gave himself a time limit and that he was just going to keep chasing his dreams until they came alive, and it did! All of that hard work and tenacity finally paid off.</p><p>Fast forward to 2005, Maniscalco was on his way to kissing odd jobs goodbye when he went on tour with Vince Vaughn as part of The Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days and 30 Nights — Hollywood to the Heartland. The 30-day comedy tour of four stand-up comedians alongside Maniscalco included comedians, Ahmed Ahmed, John Caparulo, and Bret Ernst. The DVD was later released and was a box office hit; grossing over $600,000 in the box office.</p><p>Maniscalco was away from his waiter job for a month and had planned to return to it, however, he would score a gig as a frequent opener and decided it was time to focus solely on comedy. The pay was not much, but like his waiter job, was enough to pay his bills and had better prospects.</p><h2><strong>The Sources That Have Contributed To Maniscalo’s $16 Million Fortune</strong></h2><h3><strong>Stand-up Comedy Specials</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Sebastian-Maniscalco-2.jpg><p>Stand up comedy is perhaps one aspect of entertainment that is difficult to succeed in especially without exposure to a wider audience via TV shows or the likes, this meant that Maniscalco would have to work very hard to find his way through to the top, just becoming a regular fixture was not going to do the magic. Following the classic old school way, Maniscalco began putting his name out as frequently as possible, he did this by going to comedy clubs, being in people’s faces, and selling them DVDs.

It was in the same year that, for the first time, he came under the radar of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Forbes</a> who listed him at number 10 in their list of The World’s Highest-Paid Comedians. He was the only newcomer to that year’s list and Forbes attributed his $15 million income earned over a period of 12 months to the over 100 gigs he landed within that same period.</p><p>While his debut on the Forbes list was something to celebrate, Maniscalco was a bit indifferent about it saying that he did not want to jinx it as he did not want to be on the list in 2017 and be off it in 2018. He also told Forbes that he was a private person who was uncomfortable with details about his finances making it to the media light. According to information obtained by Pollstar, the comedian grosses an average of $238,161 at each stop and sells nearly 4,000 tickets each show.</p><p>The comedian maintained his position in the next <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Forbes</a> list but in 2019 made a giant leap to 5th place with earnings of $26 million. The leap was mostly thanks to his deal with Netflix.</p><h3><strong>Maniscalco’s Earnings Over The Years As Documented By Forbes</strong></h3><ul><li>2017 – $15 million</li><li>2018 – $15 million</li><li>2019 – $26 million</li></ul><h2><strong>The Comedian and His Family Live In A Mansion Worth $21 Million</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Sebastian-Maniscalco-house.jpg><p>With a net worth of $16 million, Sebastian Maniscalco clearly has enough to afford luxury living.
