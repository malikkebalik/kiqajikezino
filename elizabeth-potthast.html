Her parents, Chuck Potthast and Pamela Putnam, as well as her sisters, Jenn Davis and Becky Lichtwerch appeared frequently on the show. Charlie, her brother, felt the same way.</p><p>Elizabeth’s family, particularly her father Chuck and sisters, were not always supportive of Elizabeth’s husband. They continued to express their concerns about Andrei’s inability to provide Elizabeth with the support she deserved.</p><p>The way Elizabeth’s family was protective of her was often expressed clearly by the circumstances. All they want is for Elizabeth to settle down for good.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Plastic_Surgery_of_Elizabeth_Potthast>Height, Weight, and Plastic Surgery of Elizabeth Potthast</span></h2><p>Elizabeth has recently been inundated with comments from 90 Day Fiancé fans. They intended to criticize her appearance, implying that her slim figure in Instagram photos was due to photo editing or filters. Some Instagram users wondered if Elizabeth underwent plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures after giving birth to her child.</p><p>Elizabeth stood 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighed 59 kg, and measured 34-25-34 inches at the time of her death.</p><p>Despite the hate comments, she posted a video on Instagram on July 23, 2020, in which she and her husband danced merrily, showing their bodies from every angle, before kissing and snuggling. Andrei was spotted shirtless in a bathing suit, while Elizabeth was wearing a sparkly bikini.</p><p>She also captioned the short video, “To those who say I Photoshop my pictures.” The hashtags “sexy husband” and “nobody shaming” were added later.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Reach_Instagram_Twitter_Facebook_and_YouTube>Social Media Reach: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube</span></h2><p>Elizabeth had 438 thousand Instagram followers as of late July 2020.

She supported her family financially through her work as a property manager.</p><p>And, while Elizabeth worked, her husband focused on being a stay-at-home dad. He even admitted that he had no intention of going out there job-hunting.

Elizabeth and Andrei had several onscreen fights, insulting and hurling insults at one another. However, their social media updates tell a completely different story.</p><p>They appear to be having the time of their lives, with each other to fall back on when things go wrong. They appeared to have a very special bond and were not planning on getting divorced anytime soon.
