The anime follows the adventures of Touka Scott, a farmer who accidentally kills the legendary hero Sion Bladan and is forced to take his place by a necromancer named Anri Haysworth. Along with his childhood friend Yuna Eunice, Touka must face the demons that are trying to revive the Demon King and destroy the world. The anime features a colorful and diverse cast of characters, each with their own personality, abilities, and role in the story. In this article, we will introduce you to some of the main and supporting characters of the anime, and give you some background information and trivia about them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Touka Scott / Sion Bladan</h3><p>Touka Scott is the protagonist of the anime. He is a simple and honest farmer who lives in a small village with his parents and his pig. He is also a pervert who has a crush on his childhood friend Yuna. One day, he accidentally kills the legendary hero Sion Bladan, who was passing by his village, with a pit trap that he dug to catch demons. Anri Haysworth, the necromancer partner of Sion, transfers Touka’s soul into Sion’s corpse and forces him to pretend to be the hero. Touka reluctantly agrees, hoping to return to his normal life as soon as possible. However, he soon discovers that he has inherited Sion’s powers and responsibilities, and that he is the only one who can stop the Demon King from resurrecting.</p><p>Sion Bladan was the legendary hero who sealed the Demon King and his army at Hell’s Gate 10 years ago. He was revered and feared by many people, as he was the strongest and most ruthless warrior in the world. He was also a kind and gentle person who cared deeply for his friends and allies, especially Anri. He suffered from a lot of trauma and guilt due to the horrors he witnessed and caused during his journey. He eventually committed suicide by falling into Touka’s pit trap, hoping to end his suffering and save Anri from the Demon King’s curse.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Anri Haysworth</h3><p>Anri Haysworth is the deuteragonist of the anime. She is a necromancer who can manipulate the souls of the living and the dead. She is also the descendant of a clan of humans who were trapped in the Demon World and learned to use necromancy to survive. She was rescued by Sion when she was a child, and became his partner and lover. She was also cursed by the Demon King, who implanted a fragment of his soul in her body, making her a target for the demons. She is the one who transferred Touka’s soul into Sion’s corpse, and who guides him in his quest to seal the Demon King. She is a snarky and sarcastic girl who often teases and insults Touka, but she also cares for him and supports him. She is also loyal and devoted to Sion, and hopes to reunite with him someday.</p><p>Anri is voiced by Ayana Taketatsu in Japanese, and by Michelle Rojas in English.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Yuna Eunice</h3><p>Yuna Eunice is the tritagonist of the anime.

She is a brave and cheerful girl who always tries to protect her friends and her village from the demons. She is also a tomboy who likes to train and fight, and who often scolds Touka for his perverted behavior. She is unaware of Touka’s feelings for her, and sees him as a brother. She is also unaware of Touka’s true identity, and believes that he is the real Sion. She admires Sion for his heroism and strength, and wants to help him in his mission. She is also jealous of Anri, who she thinks is Sion’s girlfriend.</p><p>Yuna is voiced by Hibiku Yamamura in Japanese, and by Alexis Tipton in English.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Other Characters</h3><p>The anime also features many other characters who play important roles in the story.
