<time>12 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Steve Harvey and his current wife, <a href=# rel=follow>Marjorie Elaine Harvey</a>, have been together for over 15 years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Not much has changed between the two from back in the early days to now. One thing that definitely has not changed is the attraction toward each other.</p><p>The Family Feud host still looks at his wife like it is the first time he laid eyes on her. And when those expressions of awe are captured on camera and put up on the internet, they are bound to get viral. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Steve Harvey Reacts to Wife Marjorie Elaine Harvey's Stunning Look</h2><p>The latest Steve Harvey reaction to go viral wasn't his dumbfounded expressions on Family Feud. Instead, it was his reaction to seeing his partner don a blazer dress. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>On July 6, Marjorie posted a video of her stepping out with a stunning dress and Steve reacting to her look. In the short clip, Steve's wife steps&nbsp;out in a black blazer dress with a gold pin and other metallic&nbsp;detailing.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She comes around the corner and then steps into the living room, where Steve is. The camera pans to the couple as she approaches him, and the look Steve has on his face is beyond priceless. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Marjorie lets out a laugh as she notices Steve's face and she asks him if he is ready to head out. He does not utter a word. Instead, he just keeps staring at her like he had never seen such beauty.</p><p>The video became an instant hit on social media, including TikTok and Instagram, where people commented on how adorable Steve's reaction was.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"The way he looks at her the entire time," one <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote on TikTok</a>. "Steve is like where do you think you are going looking like [fire emoji]," commented another on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even though his reaction was wordless this time, Steve was no slouch with&nbsp;words to praise his spouse, either. It just so happened that this time, he could make nothing up at the moment.</p><h2>Steve Harvey's Gushings about His Wife</h2><p>Steve and Marjorie go way back. The first time he saw her was in 1987, during one of his stand-up sets.</p><p>She sat right at the front and he said to her, "I don't know who you are, but I'm going to marry you one day." And he sure did, even if it took a while. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Steve Harvey with his wife, Marjorie Elaine Harvey, in Paris in July 2022.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The couple <a href=# rel=follow>tied the knot</a> on June 25, 2007. In 2022, their marriage became 15 years old, and Steve took the opportunity to pen a long love letter to his better half and their life together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In his letter <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Good Housekeeping</a> posted on June 21, 2022, he reminisced about the time they reconnected in 2005 and how, in Marjorie, he found "somebody [he]&nbsp;could start over with."</p><p>"It was just a perfect fit," he said of their relationship. "It wasn't hard to be together."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They made each other happy, and she gave him peace&nbsp;—&nbsp;something he always longed for in his adult life. And she gave him the hope he was going to make it big one day, all over — in days when Family Feud and other great things that have now happened to him had not happened yet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also gushed about how Marjorie was better with his children than he ever was or could be. At the end, he expressed his faith in their relationship and how they would build everything back up together if it was ever lost. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKukmsOmeceaqa%2BdqWLEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteve-harvey-left-awestruck-and-speechless-at-wife-marjorie-s-stunning-look.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsteve-harvey-left-awestruck-and-speechless-at-wife-marjorie-s-stunning-look.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsteve-harvey-left-awestruck-and-speechless-at-wife-marjorie-s-stunning-look.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsteve-harvey-left-awestruck-and-speechless-at-wife-marjorie-s-stunning-look.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteve-harvey-left-awestruck-and-speechless-at-wife-marjorie-s-stunning-look.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-harvey-left-awestruck-and-speechless-at-wife-marjorie-s-stunning-look.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-did-jon-romano-do-all-about-the-school-shooter-tiktok-influencer-in-recent-videos-the-talks-t.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-did-jon-romano-do-all-about-the-school-shooter-tiktok-influencer-in-recent-videos-the-talks-t.html>What did Jon Romano do?
