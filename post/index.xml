B’zやサザンよりもとっつきにくい音楽性を持ちながらも、
その人気は爆発的で、邦楽が好きな人に知らない人はいません。
プロのバンドマンでもラルクが好きな方は多く玄人受けが良く、
さらにはロックバンドに興味のない方でもhydeさんの存在だけは誰もが知っています。
日本一カッコいいロックバンドとして、
長く天下を取り続けてきたラルクですか、
いつからか「解散」の文字が浮かぶようになりました。
それはメディアが作った偽りの話なのか、
それとも本人たちが周囲に漏らした話なのか・・・。
その真相を分かる範囲で調べて見ました。
ラルク 25周年 解散宣言 昨年行われた２５周年のラニバにて、
メンバー間に違和感があるように見えたということと、
続いてメンバー間の不仲や、事務所との問題が報じられたために、
「もしかしてラルクって解散するの？」と、
よくわからない噂まで立ってしまったそうです。
メンバーがビジネススマイルで、
絡みが硬めで違和感があったとか・・・。
さらにはTETSUさんがリーダーらしからぬ天然発言を連発し、
ユッキーさんは感情的にドラムスティックを投げる姿が見られたり・・・。
hydeさんは「山あり谷あり、本当に色々あったんだ」と意味深な発言もしてました。
そもそもボーカルのhydeさんは、最近はVAMPSの活動が多く、
「ラルクにいる時よりも伸び伸びとしてて楽しそう」ということで、
「もしかしてバンドよりも自分のユニットの方が好きなの？」というような、
被害妄想的な不安も入り混じってた時期でもありました。
しかし、昨年の年末にはhydeさんとKENさんは共にライブを行い、
さらにはVAMPSの活動停止も公表されました。
年の最後の最後に、多くの謎の報道をひっくり返すような発表が続いたので、
ファンも一安心したと思いますが、
これまでにファンを不安にさせていた解散ネタの発端はどこにあったのでしょうか？
ちなみにネットで噂される「解散宣言」はどこでも発言されてなく、
これはネット上で勝手に広がってできたキーワードだったことがわかりました。
KENが打ち上げパーティ不参加 前々からメンバーの中でKENさんだけが浮いているとされ、
まるで腫れ物扱いだったというネタですが、
これもファンは真っ向から否定しています。
２５周年パーティに参加しなかったと報じられてますが、
実際のところ、ライブ２日目の打ち上げに参加しなかっただけだとか。
なんだ、そりゃ・・・笑。。
昨年はスマップの解散報道で大きな注目が続いたために、
二番煎じでラルクが使われたのかな？なんて思ったりします。
一番面白かったのは、
スタッフがKENのタバコの許可を得るのか大変で、
KENさんがライブ中にタバコが吸えないのが嫌で辞めるとか・・・。もはやお笑いネタの域の話です。
個人的には、ガセだと信じてます。。笑（どっかの打ち上げにたまたま参加できなかった日があったのは本当かもしれませんが）
メンバーの不仲 ある記事にてバンド名とメンバー名が伏せたれた形ですが、
どう読んでもラルクを連想刺すような内容で、
メンバーの不仲が書かれたことがありました。
２０１１年に予定していたライブの際に、
ちょうど東日本大震災が起き、
その際にライブの収益の一部を寄付したいというメンバーと、
それが嫌だというメンバーとが対立して、大喧嘩になったという。。
その喧嘩が元で、メンバーの仲にヒビが入り、
長く不仲だというのです。。
本当だとしたら、本当にメンバーの名前は書くでしょうし、
信憑性がなさすぎるので、ファンもスルーしております。
ギャラ未払いで事務所と対立？ また、ボーカルのhydeさん筆頭に、
ギャラの未払いがあり、事務所と対立してるとの報道もあります。
日本を代表する４人組ロックバンド「Ｌ’Ａｒｃ～ｅｎ～Ｃｉｅｌ」（ラルクアンシエル）が、２５年間所属している芸能事務所「マーヴェリック」から年内に独立する意向であることが、本紙の取材で分かった。
ボーカルのｈｙｄｅ（４８）らがギャラの未払いなど、問題が頻発する同事務所に強烈な不信感を抱いているためだという。最悪の場合、バンド解散の可能性も急浮上している。 引用元：https://headlines.</description></item><item><title>Dr. Dre Explains What Separates Kendrick Lamar From Other Artists</title><link>/dr-dre-explains-what-separates-kendrick-lamar-from-other-artists.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dr-dre-explains-what-separates-kendrick-lamar-from-other-artists.html</guid><description>Dr. Dre has heaped high praise on Kendrick Lamar, hailing him as a special breed of talent he calls a “forever artist.”

バンドが解散して長年の歳月が流れてもなお、多くのロックファンから強い支持を集めてます。
エルレの復活が確定すると、そのチケットの倍率はとんでもないことに・・・。当選発表翌日に数十万単位のチケットが転売サイトで取引されるほどに、エルレの人気は凄まじいです。
現在、主に活動されているモノアイズでも、その人気は不動。
一つの時代を築いたロックスターとして、
多くの邦楽ロックファンから尊敬の眼差しを集められてますが、
プライベートな部分は謎が多いです。
最近は多くの若いロックミュージシャンが風紀的なネタで世間を盛り上げてますし、
過去にはグレイやミスチル、B’zなどのメジャーバンドのメンバーも、女性関係で大きなネタを発してます。
エルレの細身さんにだって、きっと濃い女性ネタはある！と思ってしまう部分はありますが、
実際には、ノースキャンダルで真っ白なのです。
細美武士は結婚してるのか？ ２０１８年時点で、細美さんが結婚してる噂は多数ありますが、
実際にはどこにも公表されておらず、
さらにはエルレの復活やモノアイズの濃厚な対バンツアーなど、
激務なスケジュールを考えると、現実的にあり得ません。
年齢的にも支えてくれる女性がいて欲しいと願う方もいると思いますが、
変な女性に騙されて、変な色がつくのは怖いですね。。
仮に結婚したとしたら、
自身の媒体から直接ファンに告げるか、
もしくはライブのMCの中でポロっと言うと思います。
個人的にはミュージシャンとか、
芸術的な才能のある女性と結婚して、
バンド活動に強い恩恵が来て欲しいなと思います。
女優やガールズバンドなど、
細美さんに憧れてる美人著名人はたくさんいるので、
正直、選び放題な気もするのですが・・・。
女性遊びがどれほどのものなのかは分かりませんね。。
人間的にも素晴らしい方なので、
事故ってデキ婚する可能性も低いですね。
現在、５０歳に近づいてる細身さんですが、生涯独身いくつもりなのかと心配にもなります。
結婚願望に対する言及はあまり聞かないので、しばらくファンのために時間を捧げるつもりなのかと思われます。
過去に高瀬友規奈が彼女と噂 過去に細美は「高瀬友規奈」という女優と噂になりました。
２０世紀少年などに出演していた女性さんですが、
世間一般的に、名前はあまり知られてませんね・・・・。
生年月日 ：1987年7月31日（30歳）
出生地： 東京都
身長 ：164 cm
血液型：A型
職業 ：女優
ジャンル： 映画、テレビドラマ、舞台
事務所：JOY MAKER
２０１６年頃の噂でしたが、
彼女と細美さんお忍びでフジロックに来ていたなど目撃談はあります。
現在の高瀬さんは俳優の小野健斗さんと交際しているので、
その噂が当初は本当だったとしても、すでに破局はしてることになります。
珍しい著名人との熱愛ネタということで、
ファンの記憶には強く残っていますが、
フジで同伴してたこと以外に決定的な証拠がないので、
そこまで真剣に受け取る気にはなりませんよね。
アイドルではなくロックスターなのです。
西野ｶﾅとの熱愛はｶﾞｾ これは今のネット社会だからこその現象ですが、
「細美武士」の名前を打ち込むと、
「西野カナ」の名前が出てくるのです。
一瞬、熱愛疑惑がある？もしくは過去にあった？と誤解されますが、
実際には何もありません。
いったい、なぜこのような現象が起きるのか・・・。
もしかしたら、細美武士さん側、もしくは西野カナさん側が、</description></item><item><title>Bismarck Police searching for missing 81</title><link>/bismarck-police-searching-for-missing-81.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bismarck-police-searching-for-missing-81.html</guid><description>Bismarck Police searching for missing 81: An 81-year-old man has gone missing in Bismarck, North Dakota, and the local police are seeking the public’s help in locating him.
