<time>31 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>His house is on the water and the beach is just two minutes away. There’s an outdoor covered living room with a spectacular view. And if you do need to venture off the property, there’s no shortage of attractive options.</p><p>“It’s not too far from the ‘Elbo Room,’ too, where I’m sure you’ve visited a few times,” says <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Matthew Tkachuk</a>, referring to the famous Fort Lauderdale, Fla., establishment, founded in 1938.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The 24-year-old couldn’t be happier with how things have worked out after last summer’s sign-and-trade that landed him in the Sunshine State. After six seasons in Calgary, he notified the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Flames</a> that he wouldn’t be re-signing with them long-term, and they orchestrated a blockbuster deal with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Florida</a> that included an eight-year, $76 million contract.</p><p>“I’m so lucky,” Tkachuk says. “It’s worked out great for me so far. My teammates and everybody have been awesome, the city is incredible, and it’s just the best place to be able to live right now. I’ve really enjoyed my time here.”</p><p>Florida is considered a Stanley Cup contender, but it’s been a bit of a slow start for the team. The Panthers have strung together back-to-back wins just twice this season and are 10-8-2 heading into Saturday’s game against the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Blues</a> at FLA Live Arena.</p><p>“It’s been a little up and down,” Tkachuk says. “It’s been too much win one, lose one, win one, lose one. I feel like we’ve left a lot of points out there with how we finish games. Quite frankly, we’ve deserved better in some cases, but in other instances, we’re nowhere near our best right now. It’s time to go on a run. Hopefully we can go on a good run here and put ourselves back into a playoff spot and stay there.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/24100509/GettyImages-1442844912-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1701 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk celebrate a goal against Tkachuk’s former teammate Jacob Markstrom. (Bruce Bennett / Getty Images)</span><p>Tkachuk is currently playing on a line with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Aleksander Barkov</a>, the All-Star center and 2021 Selke Trophy winner, and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Carter Verhaeghe</a>. He’s also spent time on a line with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sam Bennett</a>, his teammate for five seasons in Calgary.</p><p>“I’ve felt like I’ve fit in pretty perfect to everything that they have going on here in Florida and what they’ve been building for,” Tkachuk says. “Paul (Maurice) has been unbelievable for me so far. He’s gotten a lot out of me, and I’ve really enjoyed my time with him.</p><p>“Everybody on the team has just made it so comfortable for me, on and off the ice, which I think has translated to me kind of hitting the ground running with this team. I’ve got them to thank for that.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>After Wednesday’s game against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Boston</a>, Tkachuk has nine goals and 27 points through 18 games, which puts him on a pace to topple last year’s 104-point total in Calgary. But on a Florida team that was swept by <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tampa Bay</a> in the second round of the 2022 NHL playoffs, which perhaps precipitated the Panthers’ decision to trade <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jonathan Huberdeau</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>MacKenzie Weegar</a> for Tkachuk, those individual projections are insignificant.</p><p>“None of that matters unless we make the playoffs,” Tkachuk says. “I’ve said a lot recently: It doesn’t matter what you do here (in the regular season); it matters what you do then.”</p><p>Tkachuk’s numbers include one goal and one assist in Calgary’s 5-4 shootout win over Florida on Nov. 19, his first game against the Flames. He admits that the matchup was “a little weird,” but says it was great catching up with nearly a dozen former teammates who came by his new house the night before for a steak dinner.</p><p>“They loved it,” he says. “They were very happy for me that I got what I wanted this summer, and coming here and talking about life in South Florida, they got it even more. They completely understand. It’ll probably be weirder going to Calgary, but we play them on a back-to-back, so it’ll be in and out.”</p><p>The Panthers play the Flames at the Saddledome on Tuesday, where Tkachuk isn’t sure what the reception will be. He was up front with the organization about not re-signing there, which allowed them to negotiate the sizable return, so fans may take it easy on him.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A jaw-dropping trade for superstar&nbsp;Matthew Tkachuk. An instant connection with head coach Paul Maurice. A fiery determination to take down the Lightning.</p><p>How the Panthers will ‘embrace the hard’ in their quest to win a championship:</p><p>✍️&nbsp;<a href=#>@JoeSmithNHL</a><a href=#>https://t.co/QvW4yWHFZS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aDg6JXujL8</a></p><p>— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) <a href=#>October 6, 2022</a></p><p>“I don’t know,” Tkachuk says. “That’s the beauty about playing on a different team now; they can do whatever they want: boo, cheer, whatever. I’ve got no hard feelings for them at all. I appreciate everything that they’ve done for me and how they supported me. I loved playing for them. I loved interacting with them outside of the rink. Just great, great people.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“So they can do whatever they want. I could really care less, one way or the other, but I really enjoyed my time playing for them and getting to meet a lot of people in that city. It’s an unbelievable city. I guess we’ll see what happens?”</p><p>But before that happens, Tkachuk had to do a little more hosting of his own.</p><p>His parents, Keith and Chantal, and sister, Taryn, along with family from Boston, traveled to Florida for Thanksgiving</p><p>“It’s such a big holiday and something I always look forward to, spending it with tons of family,” Tkachuk says. “It’s something I really haven’t had the chance to do, playing in Calgary and being in Canada the last bunch of years.</p><p>“As you know, nobody is safe around our family when it comes to the chirping. But lots to celebrate, lots to be thankful for, and the opportunity to have so many people visit. I think we’re going to make this a tradition every year for Thanksgiving.”</p><p>Then the Blues are in Florida on Saturday. Remember them? The team and fan base that had hoped Tkachuk would come home to St. Louis and were crushed <a href=#>when the deal with the Panthers</a> ended that fantasy.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Matthew Tkachuk could've ended up with the Blues, but offers for the St. Louis native didn't measure up to what Calgary received from Florida.</p><p>The proposal included Vladimir Tarasenko, Marco Scandella and a high draft pick, a source tells <a href=#>@jprutherford</a>.<a href=#>https://t.co/XmqwzAH1gv</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QDe1IETSJk</a></p><p>— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) <a href=#>July 25, 2022</a></p><p>“I don’t know if I was close to being a Blue. That’s something that I’ll never know,” Tkachuk says. “I know my buddies were really hoping for me to come to St. Louis, but I think after coming down to Florida and seeing it down here, they are very happy that it turned out this way.”</p><p>Asked if the potential distraction in St. Louis stopped him from pushing for a trade to the Blues, he replies: “No, absolutely not.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>So Tkachuk will be on the opposite side as the Blues try to continue turning their season around, on a 7-1 run following an eight-game losing streak.</p><p>“They’ve had their ups and downs, but they’ve always been a great team to play,” Tkachuk says. “You know you’re getting a hardworking team with some insane skill, and with the way they’re playing now, it’s going to be even more of a challenge for us.”</p><p>It’ll be the second game of a back-to-back set for the Blues, who are in Tampa on Friday, so there won’t be time for a reunion with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Robert Thomas</a> or any other players the night before.</p><p>“But he’ll make his way here, whether it’s the summer or next year, I don’t doubt that,” Tkachuk says.</p><p>It’s funny how a lot more people are suddenly finding time to come and stay.</p><p>“Life is good!” Tkachuk says.</p><p>(Photo: Bruce Bennett / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57knJpbW9ka3xzfJFrZmppX2eCcLnArauhnadiwaytwqGspGWglru1tMSrqmaanKqytHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatthew-tkachuk-blues-summer-trade-target-has-no-regrets-after-landing-in-sunny-florida.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatthew-tkachuk-blues-summer-trade-target-has-no-regrets-after-landing-in-sunny-florida.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatthew-tkachuk-blues-summer-trade-target-has-no-regrets-after-landing-in-sunny-florida.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatthew-tkachuk-blues-summer-trade-target-has-no-regrets-after-landing-in-sunny-florida.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatthew-tkachuk-blues-summer-trade-target-has-no-regrets-after-landing-in-sunny-florida.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatthew-tkachuk-blues-summer-trade-target-has-no-regrets-after-landing-in-sunny-florida.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./missing-boy-5-seen-with-bruises-before-his-disappearance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./missing-boy-5-seen-with-bruises-before-his-disappearance.html>missing boy, 5, seen with bruises before his disappearance</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./internet-slams-bryan-kohberger-s-lawyer-jason-labar-for-claiming-idaho-murders-case-has-many-holes.html>Internet slams Bryan Kohberger's lawyer Jason LaBar for claiming Idaho murders case has many 'holes'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./internet-slams-bryan-kohberger-s-lawyer-jason-labar-for-claiming-idaho-murders-case-has-many-holes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
