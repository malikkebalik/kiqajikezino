In the hangman-based competition created by Merv Griffin, contestants can spin the giant carnival wheel and call a consonant, buy a vowel for $250 or solve the puzzle. Each contestant is worth the cash value of what the wheel lands on. They can continue spinning the wheel until they miss a letter, spin a bankrupt or lose a turn. The million-dollar grand prize wedge was added to the wheel in 2008, allowing contestants the opportunity to become millionaires.

For example,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wheel of Fortune</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> Season 40 had 195 episodes, so Sajak could have earned just under $77,000 per episode for the 2023-24 season. In comparison to his co-host Vanna White, she reportedly makes about $3 million annually (not including bonuses), according to </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Puck.News</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, </span>which is about five time less than Sajak.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Wheel of Fortune isn’t even Sajak or White’s main source of income – they make more money “licensing their images to casino slot machines than they do from the game show itself.” In exchange for licensing their images, the hosts earn at least $15 million each per year in royalties, licensing fees and other payments. For Sajak’s overall networth, the Wheel of Fortune host is worth $75 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</span></p><p>As for the host’s real estate properties, h<span data-preserver-spaces=true>e paid $1.8 million in June 1988 for a home in the LA suburb of Encino.

The site also estimates his net worth as $75 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p>In addition to Wheel of Fortune, Sajak appeared in the 1982 comedy film, <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Airline II: The Sequel</span>, as a newscaster. <span data-preserver-spaces=true>W</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>hen he left the daytime version of Wheel, Sajak briefly had his own late-night talk show on CBS,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> The Pat Sajak Show, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>from January 1989 to April 1990. He’s also an External Director of Eagle Publishing and is the author of multiple puzzle games, including 2007’s&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lucky Letters.</span></p><p>After the 76-year-old host announced his exit from Wheel, Sajak accepted the role of chairman for the conservative Hillside College in Michigan, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>WVID Local 4</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> reported. He previously served as the vice chairman and is also on the board of trustees of the private Christian School. “For decades, Pat Sajak has been an icon of radio and television.

That’s me selfishly screaming for you to stay! Of course you deserve an amazing retirement. Thank you for being a national treasure, sir!” one person wrote. Another Twitter user added: “Big part of my childhood with my family. Thanks for the many laughs and entertainment.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wheel of Fortune</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;officially named a replacement for Sajak on June 27, 2023.&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ryan Seacrest will take over hosting duties</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;from Sajak starting in Season 42, which is expected to premiere in the fall of 2024. “I’m truly humbled to be stepping into the footsteps of the legendary Pat Sajak. I can say, along with the rest of America, that it’s been a privilege and pure joy to watch Pat and Vanna on our television screens for an unprecedented 40 years, making us smile every night and feel right at home with them,” the veteran&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>American Idol&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>host wrote in an&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Instagram</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;statement on June 27, 2023.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Vanna White will be continuing on with Seacrest after Sajak exits. Initially, there was confusion about&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>whether White will leave after Sajak’s retirement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Some reports even suggested that Sony executives were thinking of “eliminating” White’s role altogether if the show got a well-known host who didn’t need the extra publicity. These conversations allegedly occurred during contract negotiations for White to move past the 2023-24 season.</span></p><p>Sajak officially left Wheel of Fortune in his final episode on June 7, 2024. “Well, the time has come to say goodbye,” he said in the episode. “I have a few thanks and acknowledgments before I go, and I want to start with all of you watching out there. It’s been an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes night after night, year after year, decade after decade.”</p><p>He continued, “And I’ve always felt like the privilege came with the responsibility to keep this daily half hour a safe place for family fun. No social issues, no politics, nothing embarrassing I hope, just a game. But gradually it became more than that. A place where kids learned their letters, where people from other countries honed their English skills, where families came together along with friends and neighbors, and entire generations.”</p><p>He concluded his speech, “What an honor to play even a small part in all of that. Thank you for allowing me into your lives.”</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For more on salaries, check out our gallery below to learn&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>who is the highest-paid judge on&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>America’s Got</span> Talent</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuZ2yBeYWOqZitZaOWt6K3jKyYpZmirnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-he-makes-vs-vanna-white.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-much-he-makes-vs-vanna-white.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-he-makes-vs-vanna-white.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-much-he-makes-vs-vanna-white.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-he-makes-vs-vanna-white.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-he-makes-vs-vanna-white.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-tall-is-brad-pitt-hollywood-heartthrob-s-height-is-above-angelina-jolie-and-average-american-me.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-tall-is-brad-pitt-hollywood-heartthrob-s-height-is-above-angelina-jolie-and-average-american-me.html>How tall is Brad Pitt?
