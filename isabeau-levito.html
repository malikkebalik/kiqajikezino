Her mother’s earnings would almost certainly be significant. Her mother’s net worth is currently estimated to be around <strong>$1 million.</strong></p><h2><span id=Where_was_Isabeau_Levito_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Isabeau Levito born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p><strong>On March 3, 2007,</strong> Isabeau was born in Mount Holly, Philadelphia. Chiara decided to take Levito ice skating in his New Jersey neighborhood when he was 2.5 years old, over 12 years ago. Chiara Garberi arrived with her daughter Levito during a period of intense training for competitive figure skaters. Levito, who was two and a half at the time, asked if she could go on the ice.</p><p>Her mother informed her that she would require special shoes to do so. Chair was getting some rental shoes for her daughter when Levito approached her and asked if it could be her. “They’d be, eventually,” she said. During that time, Levito was first introduced to ice skates and ethics.</p><h2><span id=Is_Isabeau_Levito_Single_Relationship>Is Isabeau Levito Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>Isabeau Levito has a cheerful demeanor. Despite her youth, she has won several ice skating championships. She is now the national champion and is preparing to compete in the ice skating competition at the 2026 Olympics. If things continue to go her way, he’ll be ready for the next Olympics.</p><p>We wish her all the best in her future endeavors. Levito finished second in the 2021 U.S. Junior Championship. Not only that, but she also received a silver medal in the US Intermediate competition and is the US Juvenile Champion.</p><p>She made her junior circuit debut this season at the Junior Grand Prix. She won in France and came in second in Austria. Later, due to pandemic concerns, she was forced to withdraw her name from the Junior Grand Prix. After finishing third at the US Figure Skating Championships on Friday night, she won the championship and a bronze medal (7th January 2022). The event was held at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Isabeau_Levito_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Isabeau Levito start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Her mother Chiara used it as an incentive for the first time, telling her daughter that if she finished her meal, she would soon be able to attend her monthly ice skating classes. Levito was also proficient in private coaching when he was four years old. She began giving private daily lessons after a few years.</p><p>In addition to schoolwork, she now fits ice skating sessions and practices into her schedule six days a week. Throughout her early lessons, Yulia Kuznetsova was her coach for at least ten years. Isabeau has matured to the point where her talent has improved noticeably.</p><p>She has changed from the person she was before her classes to the person she is now at the age of 14. Her coach, Yulia Kuznetsova, claims she is now a competitive senior women’s competitor at the US Figure Skating Championships in Nashville (that will happen in January 2022).</p><p>Isabeau Levito of New Jersey won the night by finishing third in the 2022 U.S. Figure Skating Championship. She entered the nationals with the third-highest score (208.31), just 2.04 points behind second-placed Mariah Bell, and more than three times her previous best (U.S national medalist, 25).</p><p>Levito arrived at the nationals after recovering from a “lower-body” injury sustained at the Olympics in Beijing in 2026. Levito pulled out of the Junior Grand Prix Final one week before it was canceled due to Covid issues. She, 14, is currently aiming for the 2026 Olympics, as the skating competition does not appear to be far away based on her results in the US national championships.</p><p>Levito is a potential top singles skater who started leaping at the age of eight. She had persuaded her coaches by that point that she had the potential to thrive on the field. Levito, a current national champion, and national scorer, has also won several other titles, including US juvenile champion in 2018, intermediate silver medalist in 2019, junior silver medalist in 2020, and junior champion last season.</p><p>Levito is currently focusing on both her studies and her skating abilities. She is enrolled in classes through the International Virtual Learning Academy. Her coaches say she should skate until she reaches puberty and for the rest of her life.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":301440,"10":2,"11":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"15":"Arial","18":1,"21":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Figure Skating</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Andrew He</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Sarah Jindra</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfnsCirsSarGaklau2tbuO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fisabeau-levito.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fisabeau-levito.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fisabeau-levito.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fisabeau-levito.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fisabeau-levito.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fisabeau-levito.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sam-bush.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sam-bush.html>Sam Bush</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gene-austin.html>Gene Austin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gene-austin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
