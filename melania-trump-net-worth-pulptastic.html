She is best known for being the third wife of former President Donald Trump, whom she married in 2005.</p><p>Aside from her role as first lady, Melania has appeared in the 2001 film “Zoolander” and made appearances on her husband’s NBC reality series “The Apprentice” from 2004 to 2015. Prior to moving to America in 1996 to pursue modeling in New York City, she modeled in Paris and Milan. Melania has graced the covers of several magazines, including “Vogue,” “Harper’s Bazaar,” “InStyle,” “Vanity Fair,” and “Glamour.”</p><p>In 2016, Melania received criticism after a speech she gave at the Republican National Convention appeared to have plagiarized parts of Michelle Obama’s 2008 Democratic Convention speech.</p><h2><span id=Melanias_Early_Life>Melania’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Melania Trump, born Melanija Knavs, was born on April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, SR Slovenia. Her parents, Amalija and Viktor, worked in the clothing and automotive industries respectively. Melania often modeled for her mother’s employer, Jutranjka, and grew up in Sevnica with her sister Ines. Despite her father’s membership in the League of Communists of Slovenia, Melania and Ines were baptized as Catholics. She attended Ljubljana’s Secondary School of Design and Photography and briefly studied design and architecture at the University of Ljubljan before dropping out after a year.</p><h2><span id=Early_Modeling_Career>Early Modeling Career</span></h2><p>Melania began modeling at age 5 and signed with a Milan modeling agency at 18. She was the runner-up in “Jana Magazine’s” 1992 “Look of the Year” competition and posed for sexually explicit photos in a French men’s magazine in 1996.</p><h2><span id=Business_Ventures>Business Ventures</span></h2><p>Trump launched a jewelry collection with QVC called Melania Timepieces & Jewelry in 2010 and created the Melania Skin Care Collection. However, in 2017, the companies that manufactured her products cut ties with her. In 2016, her business ventures made $15,000-$50,000 in royalties.</p><h2><span id=Melania_Trumps_time_as_First_Lady>Melania Trump’s time as First Lady</span></h2><p>Melania became the first lady of the United States in January 2017 and moved into the White House in June of that year. She had a staff of 11 and focused on the prevention of online bullying with her “Be Best” campaign. Melania was born outside of the United States, only the second first lady to do so.</p><p>During her time as first lady, Melania helped plan a state dinner honoring French president Emmanuel Macron and visited the National Gallery of Art with his wife, Brigitte. She also embarked on a solo tour of four African countries, where she bottle-fed baby elephants, spent a day at a school in Malawi, and visited an orphanage in Nairobi.</p><p>Despite her “Be Best” campaign, Melania received criticism for her husband’s consistently hostile behavior on Twitter. In June 2018, she spoke out against the Trump administration’s treatment of illegal immigrants and visited the Upbring New Hope Children’s Shelter in McAllen, Texas, where 55 immigrant children were being kept. Melania stated that she wanted to help reunite the children with their families and called for “successful immigration reform” that doesn’t involve separating families.</p><h2><span id=Melania_Trumps_Controversial_Lawsuit_Against_Daily_Mail>Melania Trump’s Controversial Lawsuit Against “Daily Mail”</span></h2><p>In February 2017, Melania Trump filed a $150 million lawsuit against the “Daily Mail,” a British tabloid, for publishing an article that accused her of working as an escort during her time as a model. Melania claimed that the article caused her to miss out on “multimillion dollar business relationships,” but she later amended the lawsuit to focus on her emotional distress instead.</p><p>In April 2017, the “Daily Mail” retracted the statements made in the article, and the lawsuit was settled for $2.9 million.</p><h2><span id=Melania_Trump_Buys_15_Million_Apartment_in_Trump_Tower>Melania Trump Buys $1.5 Million Apartment in Trump Tower</span></h2><p>In January 2016, Melania Trump purchased a 1-bedroom apartment on the 33rd floor of Trump Tower for $1.5 million. The Trumps already owned a penthouse that took up three floors of the building, leading to speculation that Melania may have bought the apartment to use as a library.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC5xKWYp6GRYsGzwcypZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmelania-trump-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmelania-trump-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmelania-trump-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmelania-trump-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmelania-trump-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmelania-trump-net-worth-pulptastic.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-marcus-stoinis-net-worth-franchise-fee-salary-and-brand-endorsements.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-marcus-stoinis-net-worth-franchise-fee-salary-and-brand-endorsements.html>What is Marcus Stoinis net worth, franchise fee, salary and brand endorsements?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-wears-zombie-bride-halloween-costume-freakishly-scary-hollywood-life.html>Kourtney Kardashian Wears Zombie Bride Halloween Costume Freakishly Scary Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-wears-zombie-bride-halloween-costume-freakishly-scary-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
