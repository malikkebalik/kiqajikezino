<time>05 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Darryl Stephens is most recognized for his role as Noah Nicholson in the film ‘Noah’s Arc.’ Stephens has been in the industry since the early 2000s, but he has been in fewer productions throughout the years, with Darryl making brief appearances in some of them.</strong></p><p>Regardless, fans enjoy seeing the actor on screen. He currently features in the series ‘B Positive,’ and seeing him on-screen makes people curious about his love life and whether he has a partner or a boyfriend.</p><h2>Is Darryl Stephens dating anyone?</h2><p>Darryl Stephens is an openly gay man with a partner. Of all, we would expect nothing less from someone as attractive as Stephens. The ‘B Positive’ star and his boyfriend are in a nice and healthy relationship.</p><p>He shares his life with his lover on social media and is open about their relationship. He and his partner had a daughter together, and life couldn’t be better for the two fathers.</p><p>Stephens shared a glimpse of their life with their child on <strong>June 21, 2021</strong>. He shared a photo of his partner reading his son a bedtime story in their children’s playroom, and the image is as pure as it gets.</p><p>Stephens also posted a father’s daily gratitude post with the message, “Happy First Father’s Day, Baba.” The three-person family is presently residing in Los Angeles.</p><p>Stephens’ life was radically altered by having a child. It was a change in his life that nearly shifted his professional career.</p><p><strong>“I think it’s one of the greatest gifts of life to wake up every day and take care of someone,” he said in an interview with Them magazine.</strong><br><strong>“All of a sudden, it becomes about something real, something other than your own ego…</strong><br><strong>I believe it has transformed me for the better.</strong></p><p>A life with a new child is without a doubt the greatest blessing ever, and this blessing that he received with his partner caused him to reconsider his career goals.</p><p>So and so considered leaving acting. The show ‘Noah’s Ark’ brought him a lot of attention because it centered around his character, who was gay and looking for love.</p><p>‘Noah’s Ark’ was one-of-a-kind, and it truly was a watershed moment for the industry, as viewers saw a rare yet authentic portrayal of the black queer community.</p><p>Both the show and his performance had an impression on the public, and to this day, many refer to him as Noah. He considered leaving the industry, but his daughter was a blessing that brought him and his lover good fortune.</p><p>He booked projects like ‘Twenties’ and ‘Good Trouble’ just before the birth of their kid. Eventually, during the reunion of ‘Noah’s Arc,’ he reflected himself, “OK, well, maybe it was a little reckless move to take your hands off, or maybe that was exactly the perfect decision.”</p><p>“Relieve yourself of the burden.”</p><p>We’re glad he didn’t give up acting entirely. Darryl and his boyfriend have reached significant milestones in their relationship. Darryl has progressed from partner to father, and all that remains is for him to marry and claim the title of spouse.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jessica Blank</a></h3>Jessica Blank estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
