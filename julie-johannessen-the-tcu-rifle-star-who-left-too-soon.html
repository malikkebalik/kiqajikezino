<time>04 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Update: The cause of the death of Julie Johannessen was not a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We’ll update this whole again as soon as possible.</p><p>Julie Johannessen was a talented and passionate rifle shooter who had a bright future ahead of her. She was a freshman at Texas Christian University (TCU), where she was a member of the acclaimed rifle team. She helped her team secure the second place at the NCAA Championships in her first year of competition. However, her life was tragically cut short on April 23, 2023, when she was found dead in her dorm room. The cause of her death is still unknown and under investigation. This article will pay tribute to Julie Johannessen and her achievements, as well as explore the possible factors that led to her demise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Family of Shooters</strong></h2><p>Julie Johannessen was born in Fredrikstad, Norway, on June 15, 2002. She came from a family of shooters, as both her parents and her sister Camilla were involved in the sport. Camilla is also a rifle star who competes for Nebraska in the rifle team. Julie often joked about the friendly rivalry among her family members to see who was the best shot.</p><p>Julie started shooting when she was six years old and quickly developed a passion for it. She competed in several national and international events, winning medals and accolades. She was a member of the Norwegian national team and represented her country at the 2019 European Games in Minsk, Belarus. She also participated in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, where she finished 12th in the women’s 10-meter air rifle event.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Dream Come True</strong></h2><p>Julie Johannessen had always dreamed of studying and competing in the United States, where the sport of rifle shooting is more popular and prestigious than in Norway. She received several offers from different universities, but she chose TCU because of its reputation and its coach Karen Monez.</p><p>Monez is a former Olympian and a four-time All-American who has led the TCU rifle team to nine consecutive NCAA appearances and four national titles. She was impressed by Julie’s skills and personality and offered her a full scholarship to join the team.</p><p>Julie was thrilled to accept the offer and moved to Fort Worth, Texas, in August 2022. She enrolled as a pre-Business student with a strong interest in psychology. She quickly adapted to the new environment and made friends with her teammates and classmates. She also excelled in her academics, maintaining a 3.8 GPA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Star on the Rise</strong></h2><p>Julie Johannessen proved to be a valuable addition to the TCU rifle team, which is one of the best in the nation. She competed in both air rifle and smallbore events, showing remarkable consistency and improvement throughout the season. She averaged 595.5 in air rifle and 583.9 in smallbore, ranking among the top shooters in the country.</p><p>She also helped her team achieve remarkable results, such as winning the Patriot Rifle Conference title and qualifying for the NCAA Championships. At the NCAA Championships, which were held in March 2023 at Ohio State University, Julie performed exceptionally well, scoring 596 in air rifle and 585 in smallbore. She also made it to the final round of the individual air rifle event, where she finished seventh. Her scores contributed to TCU’s second-place finish behind West Virginia, which was the best result for the team since 2012.</p><p>Julie Johannessen received several honors for her outstanding performance, such as being named an All-American by the Collegiate Rifle Coaches Association (CRCA) and being selected as the Patriot Rifle Conference Freshman of the Year. She also received praise from her coach Monez, who said that Julie was “a very talented shooter with a great work ethic and a positive attitude.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Mystery Unsolved</strong></h2><p>Julie Johannessen seemed to have everything going for her: a successful career, a supportive family, a loving boyfriend, and a bright future. However, something went terribly wrong on Sunday, April 23rd, 2023, when she was found dead in her dorm room at Moncrief Hall by her roommate.</p><p>The news of her death shocked and saddened everyone who knew her, especially her teammates and coaches. They described her as a kind-hearted, cheerful, and friendly person who always had a smile on her face. They also said that she was passionate about her sport and loved being part of the TCU community.</p><p>The cause of Julie’s death is still unknown and under investigation by the TCU Police Department and the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s Office. According to Frogs Today, no foul play is suspected at this time. However, some sources have speculated that Julie may have taken her own life due to stress or depression.</p><p>According to Model Fact Julie had been struggling with some personal issues before her death, such as homesickness, loneliness, anxiety, and pressure from competing at a high level. She had also been dealing with some health problems, such as a shoulder injury and a thyroid disorder. She had sought help from the TCU Counseling and Mental Health Center, but it is unclear whether she received adequate support or treatment.</p><p>According to Atinka News Julie may have also been influenced by the recent suicide of another TCU student, who was a friend of hers. The student, whose name has not been disclosed, died on April 16th, 2023, just a week before Julie. The student was also a member of the TCU community and had been suffering from mental health issues.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Legacy Remembered</strong></h2><p>Julie Johannessen’s death has left a void in the hearts of many people who loved and admired her. Her family, friends, teammates, coaches, and teachers have expressed their grief and condolences on social media and in person. They have also shared their memories and tributes of Julie, highlighting her achievements, personality, and spirit.</p><p>Julie Johannessen’s funeral was held on April 29th, 2023, in her hometown of Fredrikstad, Norway. Her family requested that donations be made to the TCU Rifle Team in lieu of flowers. The TCU community also held a memorial service for Julie on May 1st, 2023, at the Brown-Lupton University Union Ballroom. The service featured speeches, videos, music, and prayers honoring Julie’s life and legacy.</p><p>Julie Johannessen will always be remembered as a star on the rise who left too soon. She will always be a part of the TCU family and the rifle community. She will always be an inspiration to many young shooters who aspire to follow her footsteps. She will always be missed and loved by those who knew her. Rest in peace, Julie Johannessen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfn8KttcRmoaigkaO7pr%2FSnqVmrJiaerWv1Gapop6cmnq0wMCrZLCgn2K5prLTZquop12ovLC6jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjulie-johannessen-the-tcu-rifle-star-who-left-too-soon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjulie-johannessen-the-tcu-rifle-star-who-left-too-soon.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjulie-johannessen-the-tcu-rifle-star-who-left-too-soon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjulie-johannessen-the-tcu-rifle-star-who-left-too-soon.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjulie-johannessen-the-tcu-rifle-star-who-left-too-soon.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjulie-johannessen-the-tcu-rifle-star-who-left-too-soon.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kelly-baldwin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kelly-baldwin.html>Kelly Baldwin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./colin-farrell-net-worth.html>Colin Farrell Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./colin-farrell-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
