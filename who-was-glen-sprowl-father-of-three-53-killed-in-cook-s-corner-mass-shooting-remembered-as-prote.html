His actions resulted six others being injured, one of whom was his estranged wife, Marie.</p><h2 class=split>Glen Sprowl confronted John Snowling before getting shot</h2><p>According to Sprowl's friend Shawn Ambrose, he and Sprowl often discussed their plans if they were to encounter an active shooter during their extended motorcycle road trips.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Manuel Rocha: Former US ambassador arrested over accusations of secretly serving as agent for Cuba</a></p><p>“Knowing Glen, he probably ran at him to grab him,” Ambrose told the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">OC Register</a>, adding, “We talked about those scenarios. You don’t think that’s ever going to happen.”</p><p>Once Snowling had shot his estranged wife and others inside Cook’s Corner, he stepped outside and returned with a shotgun and another handgun from his truck, per witnesses.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Arizona student seriously injured in 'promposal'-gone-wrong sues school for $1M</a></p><p>Ambrose mentioned that Sprowl's friend, who was present at the scene, informed him that Sprowl followed Snowling outside, instructing people to return indoors and secure the door behind them.</p><p>“I’m going to take care of this,” Sprowl reportedly told the women at that time.</p><p>Authorities stated that Sprowl was shot when he approached Snowling. “It doesn’t surprise me. That bought a little time,” Ambrose said.</p><h2 class=split>Glen Sprowl was a father of three</h2><p>Sprowl was a father to three children - a 19-year-old, as well as a younger son and daughter who live in Arizona.</p><p>He had intentions of relocating to Arizona to be closer to them and establish a motorcycle parts company.</p><p>He was employed at a friend's environmental recycling company and referred to himself as a "contraptionist," capable of crafting or constructing anything.</p><p>Sprowl was described as an "interesting character" who held diverse jobs over the years, including working as a bouncer and traveling alongside bands.&nbsp;</p><p>Ambrose him as having a tough exterior but a big heart. He was the kind of friend who would readily help someone in need, even dropping everything for their sake.&nbsp;</p><p>Ambrose recalled a time when Sprowl rallied friends for a fundraiser to aid with his dog's surgery costs after the animal fell seriously ill a few years ago.</p><p>“He said ‘how can I help,’ no questions asked,” Ambrose recalled of Sprowl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/714819fe-775d-4ec0-a9ce-1346451752e0.png><p>Ambrose, who operates a surf and screenprinting shop in Oceanside, had known Sprowl for 30 years.</p><p>They had gone on numerous lengthy motorcycle road trips together and were planning another one shortly.</p><p>Despite his appearance as a "big tough biker guy" with tattoos and a long beard, Sprowl also enjoyed wearing polo shirts and playing golf.</p><p>He even had a fondness for surfing on occasion, as shared by Ambrose.&nbsp;</p><p>Their most cherished moments were spent riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles along endless stretches of road, taking in the breathtaking views.</p><p>“It’s like a vacation, a road trip, but you’re in the scenery,” Ambrose said, adding, “We had a lot of plans ahead of us. You become brothers.”</p><p>Sprowl was “a bit of a rascal but he grew up well,” said Bob Herrick, his uncle. “He could pick up a piano by himself; he was a forklift,” he added.</p><h2 class=split>Glen Sprowl was 'protective and heroic'</h2><p>Sprowl's cousin, Chris Herrick, 39, said, “He taught me to ride a bike and took me trick-or-treating around the neighborhood.”</p><p>He added, “He was very protective and heroic; he helped shape me as a person and the music I liked.”</p><p>Herrick mentioned that he had lost contact with Sprowl after his mother died.</p><p>However, he had been thinking about him lately, especially because he still had Sprowl's mother's ashes and wanted to return them to him.</p><p>“I had hoped he was living a good life that would honor his family,” Herrick said.</p><p>He mentioned that even when he was younger, Sprowl would put himself in danger to shield others.</p><p>For instance, in Westminster, Sprowl prevented a neighbor from bothering Herrick's mother simply by using his imposing 6ft 4 inches stature.</p><p>On another occasion, Sprowl was at a Jack-in-the-Box when he was struck by a bullet during a drive-by shooting in Santa Ana.</p><p>“It could have been lethal. But he had a purpose in the world. Maybe he was meant to sacrifice himself for others," Herrick said.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Ryan Hopkins: Man who drove while his friend fatally shot a homeless grandmother outside a California shop gets a year in jail</a></p><p><a href=#>Christina Riggs: Oklahoma nurse who killed her 2 children said 'now I can be with my babies' before execution</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerit0maepZ2eYsCxvs6wo2aekam1pr6MqJ1mrJinsqZ5lGxkpKGcobKlecinZJynn6DAbq%2FOq6Weql2irrS%2FjKyfqKeknruoedGepJ6lkpq%2FprCMmqpmqKKkwaav06KtnmWRo7FutMSrpqKb</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-glen-sprowl-father-of-three-53-killed-in-cook-s-corner-mass-shooting-remembered-as-prote.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-glen-sprowl-father-of-three-53-killed-in-cook-s-corner-mass-shooting-remembered-as-prote.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-glen-sprowl-father-of-three-53-killed-in-cook-s-corner-mass-shooting-remembered-as-prote.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-glen-sprowl-father-of-three-53-killed-in-cook-s-corner-mass-shooting-remembered-as-prote.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-glen-sprowl-father-of-three-53-killed-in-cook-s-corner-mass-shooting-remembered-as-prote.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-glen-sprowl-father-of-three-53-killed-in-cook-s-corner-mass-shooting-remembered-as-prote.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chris-pryme-qvc-death-obituary-what-happened-to-qvc-chris-pryme-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chris-pryme-qvc-death-obituary-what-happened-to-qvc-chris-pryme-husband.html>Chris Pryme Qvc Death Obituary: What Happened to QVC Chris Pryme Husband?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-the-society-s-star-alex-macnicoll-dating-now.html>Who Is The Society's Star, Alex MacNicoll Dating Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-the-society-s-star-alex-macnicoll-dating-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
