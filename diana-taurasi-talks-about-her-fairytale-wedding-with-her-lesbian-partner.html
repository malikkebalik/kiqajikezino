It was one of the times where all our families were together, all the people we love and care for in the city that we met and evolved as teammates and wives now. It’s been pretty cool.”</p><p>Now, Diana is married and there is nothing to hide about her sexuality, she opened about her little secret. On an interview when asked about her marriage and a lesbian secret she said;</p><p>“That was our special thing”</p><p>She added,</p><p>“We never kept it secret, we just didn’t want that to be an issue ever. We knew when we walked through those doors, it was time to put work in and be professional.”</p><p>The whole world shared happiness as congratulation on ways from all around the world.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Also congrats to <a href=#>@DianaTaurasi</a> and Penny on the marriage.

Though, there are lots of times where Taurasi has hinted but never left a trace for the exact fact.</p><p>As every professional would like to basically stick to their work, Taurasi never opened about her boyfriend or if she is dating someone. In interviews, she is always bossing around, when asked about her private life she easily skips the part by using her unique sense of humor.</p><p><strong>Also, See:&nbsp;<a class=yoast-link-suggestion__value href=# rel=noopener>Who Is Porschla Coleman’s Husband?
