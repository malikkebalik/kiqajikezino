<time>14 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Are you looking for a way to earn money by playing games on your phone? If so, you might have come across Easy Wall, an app that claims to reward you for using third-party apps and games. But is Easy Wall app legit, or is it another scam that will waste your time and data? In this article, we will give you a comprehensive review of Easy Wall app, covering its features, pros, cons, and payment methods. We will also answer some of the most frequently asked questions about Easy Wall app, such as:</p><ul><li>How does Easy Wall app work?</li><li>How much can you earn with Easy Wall app?</li><li>How can you cash out your earnings from Easy Wall app?</li><li>Is Easy Wall app safe and reliable?</li><li>What are the alternatives to Easy Wall app?</li></ul><p>By the end of this article, you will have a clear idea of whether Easy Wall app is worth your time and attention, or if you should look for other options. Let’s get started!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Easy Wall App?</h2><p>Easy Wall app is a mobile application that allows you to earn tokens by using other apps and games on your phone. The app is available only for Android devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. The app is currently in its early access phase, which means it is still under development and may have some bugs or issues.</p><p>The concept of Easy Wall app is simple: you choose an app or a game from the list, install it from the Play Store, and use it for a certain amount of time. The app will track your usage and reward you with tokens based on how long you use the app or game. You can then exchange your tokens for cash rewards via PayPal, Cash App, Coinbase, or other options.</p><p>Easy Wall app claims to offer you a chance to earn money by doing something you already enjoy, such as playing games or watching videos. The app also claims to have a global user base and a variety of apps and games to choose from. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, let’s see if Easy Wall app can live up to its promises.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Does Easy Wall App Work?</h2><p>To start using Easy Wall app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store and grant it permission to monitor your app usage. You don’t need to register or sign up for an account, which is a bit suspicious, as most legit apps would require some form of verification to prevent fraud or abuse.</p><p>Once you launch Easy Wall app, you will see a dashboard with a list of apps and games that you can use to earn tokens. Some of the apps and games include TikTok, coin pushers, solitaire, and more. You will also see the amount of tokens you can earn per minute for each app or game, as well as the minimum and maximum time you need to use them.</p><p>To start earning tokens, you need to tap on the app or game you want to use, and you will be redirected to the Play Store to install it. After installing the app or game, you need to open it and use it for the required time. The app will track your usage and credit your tokens to your balance.</p><p>You can check your balance and your progress towards the payout threshold by tapping on the wallet icon on the top right corner of the screen. You will also see the exchange rate of tokens to cash, which varies depending on the payment method you choose. For example, as of writing this article, you need 1,000,000 tokens to redeem $10 via PayPal, 500,000 tokens to redeem $5 via Cash App, or 250,000 tokens to redeem $2.5 via Coinbase.</p><p>To cash out your earnings, you need to tap on the redeem button and choose your preferred payment method. You will then need to enter your email address or account number and confirm your request. The app claims to process your payment within 24 hours, but some users have reported delays or failures in receiving their money.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Much Can You Earn With Easy Wall App?</h2><p>The amount of money you can earn with Easy Wall app depends on several factors, such as the number of apps and games you use, the time you spend on them, the exchange rate of tokens to cash, and the availability of payment methods. However, based on our calculations, you can expect to earn very little with Easy Wall app, and it may not be worth your time and effort.</p><p>Let’s take an example: suppose you want to earn $10 via PayPal, which requires 1,000,000 tokens. According to the app, the average token rate per minute is 1000, which means you need to use the apps and games for 1000 minutes, or about 16.7 hours, to reach the payout threshold. That’s a lot of time to spend on your phone, and you may not even enjoy the apps and games you use.</p><p>Moreover, you need to consider the data and battery consumption of using multiple apps and games on your phone, as well as the potential security and privacy risks of granting access to your app usage. You also need to factor in the possibility of not receiving your payment, as some users have complained about.</p><p>Therefore, we can conclude that Easy Wall app is not a reliable or profitable way to earn money online, and you may be better off looking for other alternatives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Easy Wall App Legit?</h2><p>Easy Wall app is not a scam, but it is not a legit app either. It is somewhere in between, as it does not seem to have malicious intentions, but it also does not deliver on its promises. The app is still in its early access phase, which means it is not fully developed or tested, and it may have some bugs or issues. The app also has some red flags that make us doubt its legitimacy, such as:</p><ul><li>No registration or verification required: The app does not ask for any personal information or verification from its users, which is unusual for a legit app that pays money. This could indicate that the app does not care about the quality or authenticity of its user base, or that it is trying to avoid accountability or responsibility.</li><li>Low payout rate and high payout threshold: The app offers a very low exchange rate of tokens to cash, and a very high payout threshold, which makes it very hard to earn a decent amount of money. The app also changes the exchange rate and the payout threshold frequently, which could be a sign of instability or inconsistency.</li><li>Fake or low-quality apps and games: The app features some apps and games that are either fake or low-quality, such as LuckySpin, Cash Master, and 8 Ball Club. These apps and games are known to be scams or rip-offs that do not pay their users, and they could also harm your phone or compromise your data. The app also does not provide any information or reviews about the apps and games it features, which could indicate a lack of transparency or credibility.</li><li>Negative user feedback: The app has a lot of negative reviews and ratings on the Play Store, with many users complaining about not receiving their payments, having technical issues, or being dissatisfied with the app. The app also does not respond to the user feedback or address the user concerns, which could indicate a lack of customer service or support.</li></ul><p>Based on these red flags, we can say that Easy Wall app is not a legit app that you can trust or rely on to earn money online. The app may not be a scam, but it is certainly not worth your time and attention.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Are the Alternatives to Easy Wall App?</h2><p>If you are looking for a better way to earn money online by playing games or using apps, you may want to check out some of the alternatives to Easy Wall app, such as:</p><ul><li>Mistplay: Mistplay is a popular and legit app that pays you to play games on your phone.
