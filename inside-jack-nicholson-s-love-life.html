<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Inside Jack Nicholson's long dating history: The actor has fathered six children with multiple women! &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Known for his roles in <i>Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, Chinatown, Terms of Endearment,</i> and a myriad more, <strong>Jack Nicholson</strong> is a legendary actor. His decades-long career has endowed him with three Oscar Awards, three BAFTAs, multiple Golden Globes, and numerous Critics Awards. &nbsp;</p><p>Born John Joseph Nicholson on April 22, 1937, in Neptune City, New Jersey, he made his acting debut in the 1958 flick,<i> The Cry Baby Killer,</i> and gradually worked his way to fame with <i>The Wild Ride, The Raven,</i> and<i> The Terror</i>. The Oscar winner is also notoriously known for his complicated personal life. More details ahead. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Jack Nicholson's Dating History! &nbsp;</h3><p>Nicholson recently showed up in public after an eighteen-month-long disappearance. The legendary star has been spotted at various games and recently, with his youngest lookalike son. Although the buzz around the Oscar winner has been slim to none in recent years, there was a time when Nicholson's philanderer ways were all the rave. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/22/11312457_950718661616800_1102399189_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684776377762.jpg><p>The actor may not boast about being the best in the business but he is a self-proclaimed ladies' man, and Jack's lengthy, and jumbled dating history stands as the ultimate evidence. Of course, he wasn't always like this. Throughout his messy love life, he has only been married once. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Easy Rider</i> actor was married to his<i> The Terror</i> co-star, <strong>Sandra Knight</strong>, from 1962 to 1968; during the period, the pair welcomed one daughter. Nicholson learned that marriage wasn't his cup of tea from the experience and swore off it. The estranged spouses kept an amicable relationship after their divorce. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/22/11373784_102243893451079_1393836912_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684776383914.jpg><p>Nicholson's marriage reportedly unraveled amid his affair with<strong> Mimi Machu,</strong> who he continued dating after his divorce. The illicit affair fizzled out quickly and <i>The Shining </i>actor didn't waste time dating another beauty. He dated his best friend, <strong>Dennis Hopper</strong>'s ex-wife, <strong>Michelle Phillips</strong>, for a year after his divorce.</p><p>Nicholson had an on-and-off relationship with actress <strong>Angelica Huston</strong>, from 1973 to 1990. Jack and Huston were a power couple for the good two decades but the Oscar winner still carried his playboy reputation. The actress would find much evidence of Nicholson's infidelities while they were together but Huston overlooked it all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/22/11355780_359338424260868_179145240_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684776390952.jpg><p>But after years of enduring Jack's unfaithful ways, Angelica ended it with Jack after <i>The Shining</i> actor got a young woman named<strong> Rebecca Broussard </strong>pregnant. In an interview, Angelica recalls how she came on her then-beau with punches in a fit of rage upon learning the news. &nbsp;</p><p>Former model <strong>Janice Dickinson</strong> was one of the many women who Jack had an affair with. While still in a publicly known relationship with Huston, Jack not only cheated on her with many but also made advances on some very well-known stars, including <strong>Meryl Streep, Marie Helvin</strong>, who was married at the time, and actress <strong>Lara Flynn Boyle.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nicholson's dating history boils down to nothing but a slew of brief flings and liaisons. Another unlikely figure who has admitted to a passionate stint with the actor is <strong>Margaret Trudeau, </strong>ex-wife of former Canadian prime minister <strong>Pierre Trudeau. &nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/22/11326604_849903885065197_1924335257_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684776398096.jpg><p>The Oscar winner's jumbled dating timeline also includes <strong>Amber Smith, Julie Delpy, Karen Mayo-Chandler</strong>, and <strong>Winnie Hollman.</strong> Nicholson was famously linked with model <strong>Kate Moss </strong>in the early 2000s. The wild dating rumors when swirling after Jack <a href=#>revealed </a>his hots for the supermodel in an interview. &nbsp;</p><h3>Get to Know Jack Nicholson's Children! &nbsp;</h3><p>The <i>Chinatown </i>actor has no qualms about flaunting his womanizing spirit. Nicholson once claimed that he had slept with over 2000 women in his heyday. If that's really the case then Jack has definitely done an efficient job of limiting the unwanted results of carnal relationships. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/22/11356912_843570319072667_562618619_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684776408658.jpg><p>The actor has fathered six children with five different women. Nicholson's oldest, <strong>Jennifer Nicholson</strong>, 59, is the only child who wasn't born out of wedlock or an illicit affair. Jennifer is a movie set designer and interior designer. She is a doting mother of two. &nbsp;</p><p><i>The Shining </i>actor's second-born, <strong>Caleb Goddard,</strong> was the outcome of one of Jack's many flings. Caleb was born to the late actress, <strong>Susan Anspach</strong>, and for many years he had to bear the public humiliation of being rejected by his biological father. Nicholson allegedly provided for Caleb in private while rejecting the paternity in public until 1998. &nbsp;</p><p>The father-son duo get along well now and Caleb has pursued a career in showbiz as an actor, writer, and more. Nicholson's third kid,<strong> Honey Hollman</strong>, was born to Winnie Hollman, in 1981. Honey has been living a low-profile life in Europe. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicholson's youngest kid, Tessa Gourin, has been estranged from the Oscar winner for years!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The Oscar winner's fourth of the brood, <strong>Lorraine Nicholson</strong>, was born to Rebecca Broussard, who Jack fathered while he was dating Huston. Lorraine has followed in her father's footsteps as an actress and has made several appearances with her father.&nbsp;</p><p>As Jack continues his romance with Rebecca after his split from Angelica, the actor ended up welcoming another kid with her in 1992. The former pair's son, <strong>Ray,</strong> is an aspiring actor, and to some, a spitting image of a young Nicholson. &nbsp;</p><p>Jack's youngest kid, daughter <strong>Tessa Gourin</strong>, was born from an affair he had with a waitress named <strong>Jenine Gourin</strong>. <a href=#>As per Tessa</a>, the Oscar winner has shown no interest in keeping a father-daughter relationship with her. Despite the ordeal, Tessa has ventured into acting and has appeared in a handful of films. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnqrrcKkZKehk528rb%2FOp6pmpJ%2Brsm64yJ%2Bc</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-jack-nicholson-s-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-jack-nicholson-s-love-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-jack-nicholson-s-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-jack-nicholson-s-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-jack-nicholson-s-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-jack-nicholson-s-love-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joanna-newsom.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joanna-newsom.html>Joanna Newsom</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alex-debrincat-bio-wiki.html>Alex DeBrincat Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alex-debrincat-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
