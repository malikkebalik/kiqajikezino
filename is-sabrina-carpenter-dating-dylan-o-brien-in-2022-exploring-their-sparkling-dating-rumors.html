She was born on May 11, 1999.&nbsp;Carpenter got her start in acting on the TV crime show Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She also had a recurring role on the three-month-long Fox show The Goodwin Games. She was the star of the Disney Channel comedy show Girl Meets World from 2014 to 2017. In 2016, she was in the network’s TV movie Adventures in Babysitting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sabrina Carpenter: Early Life Details</h2><p>Carpenter was born to David and Elizabeth Carpenter on May 11, 1999, in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. He grew up in East Greenville.&nbsp;She grew up with three older sisters and went to school at home. &nbsp;When she was 10, she started putting videos of herself singing on YouTube. Her father built her a recording studio so that she could pursue her love of music.&nbsp;In 2011, she came in third place at The Next Miley Cyrus Project, a singing contest run by Miley Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Sabrina Carpenter’s Boyfriend Now?</h2><p>For some people, age is nothing but a number. PerezHilton says that it looks like Sabrina may be dating an older man. The news source says that the actress has been rumored to be dating actor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dylan O’Brien</a>, who is eight years older than she is.</p><p>In reality, it’s not unusual for famous people to date people who are younger than them, like Gabrielle Union and Dwayne Wade or Queen Bey and Jay-Z. But age is still a controversial thing in relationships, and Sabrina’s dating life is proof of that, especially since Dylan has dated younger women before.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SABRINA CARPENTER AND DYLAN O'BRIEN????

It looks like the two were seen “making out” in New York City over the weekend of September 9th.</p><p>Even without an official title, it’s become normal to see celebrities kissing and clearly enjoying each other. Even so, people on social media still think Sabrina and Dylan are a new couple. People on social media think that the proof is in the pudding because many celebrities like to play the “I’m single” card or just don’t talk about their relationships until they are sure they are.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Are Sabrina Carpenter’s Ex-Boyfriends?</h2><p>Sabrina has either dated or been said to be dating a number of Disney Channel stars over the past few years. First of all, Sabrina was once linked to Joshua Bassett, who played Troy in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.</p><p>Little was known about their rumored relationship until Josh’s ex-girlfriend, co-star of HSMTMTS <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Olivia Rodrigo</a>, released her hit song “Driver’s License.” In it, she said Josh was now “with that blonde girl who always made me doubt.”</p><p>Even though Sabrina and Josh kept their relationship quiet, as most celebrities do, it was pretty clear they were together—until now.</p><p>Fans also cheered for her and her co-star on Girl Meets World, Corey Fogelmanis, when they were on the show together. Sabrina wrote on Instagram in 2018 to wish him a happy birthday and that she was glad to know him but would “not date” him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-177-1024x536.png><p>Bradley Steven Perry, who was in the movie Good Luck Charlie, was her boyfriend once. This was in 2014 when they were both pretty young (or teenagers, but the same thing). It was a long time before Sabrina’s singing career took off and she moved on from the Disney Channel. Riverdale star Casey Cott was also in Sabrina’s music video for her single “Why,” which led to rumors that she was dating him. However, these were just rumors.</p><p>When it comes to Sabrina and Dylan’s relationship, only time will tell if they are just having fun together or if they are building something that will last. Isn’t it great when two famous people get together?</p><p><strong>Related stories recommended by this writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Is Jennie And Taehyung Dating?
