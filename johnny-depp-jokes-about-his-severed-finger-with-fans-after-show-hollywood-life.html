While counting out the child’s fingers, he quipped that he has slightly less. “You have five. I have four and seven-eighths. Math,” he said, before going on to sign more autographs for fans who seemed very excited to catch a glimpse of the actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/johnny-depp-jokes-about-severed-finger-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Johnny’s severed finger has been a serious point of discussion during the defamation trial between the two exes, which the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory star won on Wednesday. A piece of Johnny’s middle finger was cut off in the heat of a 2015 argument with Amber, 36, in Australia. During his testimony, Johnny claimed that the “chunk” of his finger was cut off, after it made contact with a bottle that his ex-wife allegedly threw at him. “I looked down, and realized the tip of my finger had been severed, and I was looking directly at bones sticking out and the meaty portion of your inside of your finger, and blood was just pouring out,” he said. Johnny revealed that he’d then started using the blood in his finger to write messages on the wall.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>When Amber took the stand, she said that she didn’t realize that part of Johnny’s finger was severed until she went downstairs the next morning. She said that she saw the “incoherent” messages that the&nbsp;Black Mass&nbsp;star had written on the walls, before realizing what he’d been using to write them. “I figured out he was missing a finger. He kind of held it up and I said, ‘What did you do?'” she said, before saying that he had to call his security guard&nbsp;<strong>Jerry Judge.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>winning the defamation trial</a> against Amber, Johnny has seemed like he’s very<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> happy with the verdict</a> of the trial, which found that the Aquaman star had defamed him in a 2018 op-ed for&nbsp;The Washington Post. The actor has been joining guitarist Jeff Beck at a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>series of his concerts</a> in the UK, since the trial had its closing arguments. Other than the shows, he was seen at an<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> English pub with some fans</a> after the jury ruled in his favor, and he also took some time to visit a wild life rescue, where he was photographed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holding an adorable badger</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e49sZqOnmKO7unnDnqepZZqkuKZ5xaKloJ2iYrOiutJmqqGnp2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohnny-depp-jokes-about-his-severed-finger-with-fans-after-show-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohnny-depp-jokes-about-his-severed-finger-with-fans-after-show-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohnny-depp-jokes-about-his-severed-finger-with-fans-after-show-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohnny-depp-jokes-about-his-severed-finger-with-fans-after-show-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohnny-depp-jokes-about-his-severed-finger-with-fans-after-show-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohnny-depp-jokes-about-his-severed-finger-with-fans-after-show-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./new-parents-alert-barry-keoghan-is-expecting-a-child-with-his-girlfriend-alyson-sandro.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./new-parents-alert-barry-keoghan-is-expecting-a-child-with-his-girlfriend-alyson-sandro.html>New Parents Alert!
