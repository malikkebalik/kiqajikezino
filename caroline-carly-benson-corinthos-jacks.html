Bobbie Spencer had given Carly up for adoption and Carly wanted payback. Sleeping with her mom's husband was the best retribution, and it worked! After Carly's fling with Tony was discovered, he and Bobbie divorced. Unfortunately, it didn't bring the happiness Carly had hoped for.</p><p>Luck with men hasn't been her strong suit. Although her brief sexual interlude with Jason formed a lasting friendship, her liaisons with AJ Quartermaine and Lorenzo Alcazar were short-lived. Her most consuming love has been with mobster, Sonny Corinthos, but that's been tumultuous at best. Her children have been kidnapped, she's been held hostage for the child she carried, and she's been at death's door more than once. After her son Michael was shot by a bullet intended for Sonny, she finally looked to the future. She recommited to her husband Jax and coerced Sonny to sign away all rights to his sons.</p><p>Over the following year, her stance against Sonny softened, but they both agreed to keep the distance to protect everyone from the danger his life brings. She recommited to Jax and even got pregnant with his child. She quickly learned, however, that she has a rare blood disorder that could cause her to stroke out and die during pregnancy.</p><p>Michael eventually woke up from his coma, but was angry and often fought with his mother. Claudia kidnapped Carly after she was outted as the one who put Michael's shooting in motion and the women ended up in a cabin where Carly went into labor. Claudia helped her give birth and then tried to run off with the baby, but Michael found them and hit her over the head with an axe handle, thereby killing her.</p><p>Carly, along with Sonny and Jason, spent the next few months trying to protect her son from the cops, while bonding with her new daughter, husband and boys. When the truth about Jax's involvement in Dante's investigation of Sonny was revealed, she took Morgan and Josslyn and moved out of the house.</p><p>Despite everyone's best attempts, Michael went to prison. In the aftermath, Carly and Sonny had sex and then she vowed revenge on Dante and Lulu for their perceived role in Michael's incarceration.</p><p>Carly brought Brook Lynn to town to seduce Dante, thereby breaking up him and Lulu. The plan failed however. Carly then focused on reuniting with Jax, but was distracted again when Brenda returned to town.</p><p>Brenda and Dante's connection made Carly curious, so she made it her mission to discover what they were hiding. She clashed with Jax over his ex and they eventually broke up again. She then discovered Brenda's secret, but Brenda revealed it before Carly could.</p><p>Once that was settled, Carly's next crisis centered on Josslyn, who needed a kidney transplant. After Jake died from getting hit by a car, Carly pleaded with Jason to donate his son's organs to her daughter. Jason appealed to Elizabeth and Lucky and they eventually agreed to the procedure, thereby saving Josslyn's life.</p><p>Once Josslyn was in the clear, she and Jax clashed over custody. When Franco made a threat against Josslyn, Jason hired Shawn to protect Carly and her daughter despite Jax’s protests. Carly turned to Sonny for help and he used his muscle to ensure Carly was awarded full custody, so Jax left town with Brenda.</p><p>Jax briefly took back Josslyn but Shawn got her back for Carly. But after Jax’s plane crashed he was presumed dead and Carly, fed up with Sonny’s heavy-handed ways, ordered him out of her life. She changed Morgan’s last name and sent him to military school where Sonny would be of no influence.</p><p>Shawn and Carly indulged a flirtation while he protected her and Josslyn from Franco. Carly admitted to Shawn that she thought Jax was really alive. Michael overheard and exposed his mother in front of the whole town. Livid, Michael asked Johnny Zacchara for a position in his syndicate. Carly offered to sleep with Johnny if he turned Michael away. Johnny agreed, but Carly stalled while she tried to dig up dirt on Johnny with Luke.</p><p>Luke found out that Claudia and Gino Soleito were Johnny’s real parents and he sold the info to Sonny. Carly was devastated in her part as Johnny’s world fell apart. She ignored everyone’s warnings and fell for the mobster. But when she found him in bed with Kate Howard she refused to forgive him despite his pleas.</p><p>Todd Manning checked into the Metro Court and he and Carly bonded over their fierce protectiveness of their children. Todd remained close to Carly while Josslyn was hospitalized from a mystery injection, which turned out to be immunization from a deadly toxin in the Port Charles water supply. The traumatic event made Carly commit herself to Johnny, but she drew the line at sailing away with him on the Haunted Star the night before Sonny's wedding to Kate. She was devastated when at that wedding, Kate’s alter Connie emerged and told everyone she was already married to Johnny.</p><p>Carly turned to Todd for comfort and friendship through Johnny’s deception, Jason’s death, and the return of Michael’s father AJ Quartermaine. Carly finally slept with Todd, but soon regretted it when she learned that he had known for months that Johnny had killed Starr’s family, that he had switched Sam's healthy son with a dead baby, and that he had known Jason was the baby’s bio-dad. Carly had regrettable revenge sex with AJ.</p><p>Morgan returned home with a large gambling debt and a new girlfriend, Kiki Jerome. Carly was not impressed with Kiki but more upset to learn Franco was still alive. Sonny and Carly asked Shawn to kill Franco. Sonny changed his mind, so Carly lied to Shawn that the hit was back on. Olivia was hit instead of Franco, but the bullet came from a different gun.</p><p>Carly struggled to keep her family close as her sons fought over Kiki and Sonny spiraled after Connie was murdered. She softened toward Franco when his brain tumor was removed but pushed her growing feelings aside to date new-to-town businessman Derek Wells. But when she learned Franco’s parents were Heather Webber and Scott Baldwin, she became his confidante, and soon his lover.</p><p>Jealous, Heather kidnapped Carly and held her captive underneath Wyndemere. Franco was shot rescuing her and Carly professed her love to him during his recovery. As they grew closer, Carly confided in him that Sonny was AJ’s real killer. He agreed to keep the secret so as not to devastate Michael.</p><p>Carly grew close to Sonny because of the secret, and Ava’s pregnancy with either Sonny or Morgan’s child. Carly eventually cheated on Franco with Sonny, and though she regretted it, she kept falling into bed with Sonny. When Franco proposed, Carly said yes, but still cheated with Sonny. Suspicious, Franco gifted Carly with an evil eye necklace that was really a camera. His fears she was cheating with Sonny were confirmed, yet he still moved forward with a Halloween 2014 wedding to Carly. Meanwhile, Carly remained in the dark about Franco’s knowledge of her affair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvCoZirmZOpsrO%2FjpyYq6ecnrumecKaqaWxXZeyr7%2FOp2Scp6Keu7W0zqxko5mToMBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcaroline-carly-benson-corinthos-jacks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcaroline-carly-benson-corinthos-jacks.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcaroline-carly-benson-corinthos-jacks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcaroline-carly-benson-corinthos-jacks.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcaroline-carly-benson-corinthos-jacks.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcaroline-carly-benson-corinthos-jacks.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christian-braun-sister-brother-ethnicity-and-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christian-braun-sister-brother-ethnicity-and-parents.html>Christian Braun | Sister Brother Ethnicity And Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./will-there-be-a-hangover-part-4-everything-we-know-hollywood-life.html>Will There be a Hangover Part 4?
