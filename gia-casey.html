DJ ENVY has since come forward to apologize to the media for his behavior. She told The Shade Room the following about the cheating scandal:</p><p>“I have to accept him, accept what he did, and move on in a positive way that nurtures us both.” Just because you have the power to mistreat someone does not imply you should do so. That doesn’t mean you should take advantage of it. I was responsible to do better after I learned better.”</p><p>DJ ENVY and Casey married shortly after college and had been together since they were 16 and 15 years old, respectively. Gia went on “The Breakfast Club” on April 19 to discuss some of the highlights from their March release, Real Life, Real Love: Life Lessons on Joy, Pain, and the Magic That Holds Us Together. Gia Casey has also stated in recent videos that DJ Envy attempted to keep her away from the hip-hop business so that he would not be exposed, hence saving his career and status within the hip-hop world. Despite their marriage’s many tears, ENVY and Gia have always been there for one another and appreciated one another. ENVY also allowed Gia to write a book on how their relationship isn’t flawless, but it does teach us how two people in love should respect one another. ENVY also made several appearances during Gia’s Book Launch. Gia and ENVY are now living a happy life with their six children, supporting them in achieving their goals and setting a good example of good parenting.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Read More: </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Kiara Glasco</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Colleen Wolfe</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>HeeJin</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Eden Summer Gilmore</span></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Author</a> <a href=# rel=tag>businesswoman</a> <a href=# rel=tag>writer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Fidelis Anosike</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Silk Boss</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfnLaiecKaqp6xXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgia-casey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgia-casey.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgia-casey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgia-casey.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgia-casey.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgia-casey.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harry-dean-stanton-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harry-dean-stanton-net-worth.html>Harry Dean Stanton Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./deborah-roberts.html>Deborah Roberts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./deborah-roberts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
