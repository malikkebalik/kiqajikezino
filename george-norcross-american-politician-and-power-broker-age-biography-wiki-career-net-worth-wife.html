In Israel, Jews constitute the vast majority of the population.</p><p>His acts were eventually shown to be entirely in support of Israel, rather than a religious connection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Norcross-Grew-Up-In-A-Lutheran-Faith.jpg><p>The 67-year-old American businessman is the eldest child of his late parents, George E.

Philadelphia Eagles NFL Week 9 game on November 5, 2023. Norcross was a season ticket holder at Lincoln Financial Field, where he displayed a draped American and Israeli flag from his luxury suite.</p><p>However, Eagles officials objected to him removing the flag, which he denied, resulting in his removal from the stadium. The power broker attacked the security officials fiercely in the viral social media footage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/George-Norcross-III-Was-Removed-From-The-Eagles-vs-Cowboys-Game-For-Showing-US-Israeli-Flag.jpg><p>A day later, George issued a statement in which he claimed that the Eagelss violently removed him despite the fact that he had done nothing wrong. Following the October 7th assaults, the US-Israeli flag he displayed was a protest that strongly backed Israel.</p><p>Furthermore, he thought it would be an important message because the Eagles used to address civil rights concerns as well as ethnic and global conflicts.</p><p>The entire world was watching the Eagles’ justification for their actions with bated breath.</p><p>Later, the NFL club issued a statement in which they stated that, while they sympathized with the victims of the attack, their ‘policy forbade signage featuring any form of non-game messaging.’</p><p>However the Norcross was reportedly removed from the game for being “physically and verbally abusive” to stadium staff.</p><p>Despite George’s threat to sue the NFL for his ejection, there has been no additional update on the situation.</p><h2>Social Media Accounts of George Norcross</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no any social media accounts found regarding George Norcross.
