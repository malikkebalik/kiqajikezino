Shayk and Cooper were together for four years before they separated.</p><p class=Zg>Irina Shayk and Bradley Cooper are parents to a 3-year-old little girl named Le de Seine Cooper. Although the pair are not together anymore, they’re still playing essential roles in their child's life.</p><p class=Zg>Shayk recently graced Elle magazine's cover for the March digital issue, where she got candid about her upbringing, career, and relationship with the actor and their daughter. The 35-year-old mom described Cooper as the most amazing dad.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk arrive at the 91st Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood and Highland on February 24, 2019 in Hollywood, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>SHAYK ON CO-PARENTING WITH COOPER</strong></p><p class=Zg>According to the outlet, Shayk and Cooper are usually photographed together with their toddler in a friendly fashion. When asked how co-parenting with the 46-year-old is, she had a unique response.</p><p class=Zg>“I never understood the term co-parenting,” she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/fashion/a35600525/irina-shayk-elle-2021/>said</a>. “When I’m with my daughter, I’m 100 percent a mother, and when she’s with her dad, he’s 100 percent her dad. Co-parenting is parenting,” she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/fashion/a35600525/irina-shayk-elle-2021/>explained.</a></p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Irina Shayk and Bradley Cooper attend 'Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology' Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2, 2016 in New York City | Photo : Images</p><p class=Zg>Even though she sees no difference between the two terms, the tabloids continue to write about her in terms of Cooper, and she is reportedly reluctant to talk about him much. "My past relationship, it's something that belongs to me, and it's private," she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/fashion/a35600525/irina-shayk-elle-2021/>said</a>.</p><p class=Zg>She further shared that she is too busy raising her one and only child. Shayk also said that she is concentrating on her life and friends and ignores what is written about her.</p><p class=Zg>According to Entertainment Tonight, the "Hercules" star revealed that after she and Cooper split up, they decided to make their daughter a priority. A source reportedly told the outlet last month that they have a friendly and cordial relationship.</p><p class=Zg>They continue to work to be a team for their little girl. While parenting, they show respect for each other, Cooper is putting his child first, and Shayk is a hands-on mother. "They both want what's best for Lea, so it's easy for them to be a team in that regard," <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.etonline.com/irina-shayk-reveals-what-its-like-co-parenting-with-bradley-cooper-161497>said</a> the insider.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>THEIR FRIENDLY PARENTING RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=Zg>Cooper and Shayk <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.etonline.com/inside-bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayks-very-friendly-relationship-after-split-159702>welcomed Lea in March 2017</a>, and they split in June 2019. Their co-parenting schedule and routine are reportedly going well between the two.</p><p class=Zg>Family is reportedly important for "The Hangover" actor. In August, he revealed that he was caring for his mother and daughter amid the pandemic.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>THEIR DAUGHTER LEA</strong></p><p class=Zg>Like Shayk, Lea is Cooper's only child. The pair also ensure that when she has important events in her life, they are present. They both <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/who-is-bradley-coopers-daughter-meet-the-actors-child-lea-de-seine/>agreed on joint custody</a> for her.</p><p class=Zg>Lea has made a red-carpet appearance with her father, where she accompanied him in October 2019, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. However, ever since the pandemic hit, they have had to go out a lot less.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>THEIR RELATIONSHIP TIMELINE</strong></p><p class=Zg>Lea’s parents started dating back in March 2015 and went on their first public date the following month. At the time, they were spotted attending a production of "Finding Neverland" in New York City.</p><p class=Zg>In August that same year, they went on vacation in Italy, where the paparazzi took private pictures. The following month, Shayk was spotted hanging out with Cooper's mother.</p><p class=Zg>Although it seemed like things were getting serious between the two, sometime in February 2016, they were reports that the pair had split. However, it turned out to be untrue as they showed up at the <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a26149191/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-relationship-timeline/>Loreal Red Obsession Party</a> in Paris and kissed in public.</p><p class=Zg>In April 2016, they made their relationship Instagram official by posting a photo of their torsos. In July that year, the former couple went on another vacation in Italy.</p><p class=Zg>Later that year, in November, news broke that they are expecting a baby. Shayk walked Victoria's Secret Fashion show that same day. In January 2019, she sparked engagement rumors for the second time.</p><p class=Zg>In February 2019, Cooper shared the stage with Lady Gaga during the Oscar awards, and their connection made it seem like it was more than just a performance. At the beginning of June, reports revealed that the pair's relationship was hanging in the balance since the show.</p><p class=Zg>Two days later, there were reports that they were spending time apart, and their daughter was the only thing holding them together. Days later, Cooper and <a class="zd d" href=#>Shayk</a> called it quits and that the singer might have had something to do with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtsbWxhZ3qqvsinmGarmJbGrHnGnqusZZOWu6W1w2aaqGWglr%2BmutOipaBlmJq%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2firina-shayk-gets-candid-about-co-parenting-her-daughter-lea-de-seine-with-ex-bradley-cooper.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2firina-shayk-gets-candid-about-co-parenting-her-daughter-lea-de-seine-with-ex-bradley-cooper.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2firina-shayk-gets-candid-about-co-parenting-her-daughter-lea-de-seine-with-ex-bradley-cooper.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2firina-shayk-gets-candid-about-co-parenting-her-daughter-lea-de-seine-with-ex-bradley-cooper.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2firina-shayk-gets-candid-about-co-parenting-her-daughter-lea-de-seine-with-ex-bradley-cooper.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2firina-shayk-gets-candid-about-co-parenting-her-daughter-lea-de-seine-with-ex-bradley-cooper.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./james-frecheville-actor-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-affair-girlfriend-net-worth-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./james-frecheville-actor-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-affair-girlfriend-net-worth-career.html>James Frecheville (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Affair, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carl-bernstein.html>Carl Bernstein</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./carl-bernstein.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
