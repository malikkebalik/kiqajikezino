She also has two younger siblings named Braison Cyrus and Noah Cyrus, a half brother named Christopher Cody Cyrus from her father former relationship, and two half siblings – Brandi Glen Cyrus and Trace Cyrus (who were adopted by Billy)- from her mother’s previous marriage .</strong></p><p>Unless you have not been a part of this world for a very long time, you do not need to be told who Miley Cyrus is. A child star who got to become one of the most successful and finest entertainers in adulthood, Miley has almost always receivedwidespread media coverage for reasons that range from her love life to her career and what have you</p><p>.</p><p>Through her parents Billy Ray Cyrus and Leticia Jean “Tish” Cyrus who were both married to other people before their relationship began, Miley has a lot of siblings most of whom have been building a career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Like every other family, the Cyrus family has faced some crisis over the years, including a Christmas Day fight that followed an argument over some conspiracy theories. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>According to the famous entertainer</a>, the fight left her mom crying and her brothers refused to speak to her for a week. But in all, the <i>Hannah Montana </i>actress has a good relationship with all the members of her family.</p><h2><strong>Miley Cyrus Has a Total of Five Siblings</strong></h2><p>As you will easily find, the singer-songwriter and actress was born to Billy Ray Cyrus and Leticia ‘Tish’ Jean. She is the couples’ first of three kids together and has half-siblings as both of her parents had children from previous relationships.</p><p>While Tish is a mother to two kids from a previous marriage, Billy has a son who was born 8 months earlier before his famous sister. In the order they were born, the Leticia and Billy kids are Brandi Glen Cyrus, Trace Cyrus, Christopher Cody Cyrus, Miley Ray Cyrus, Braison Cyrus, and Noah Cyrus.</p><h3><strong>Christopher Cody Cyrus Is The Only Paternal Half Brother She Has</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Mother:&nbsp;</strong>Kristin Luckey</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>April 8, 1992</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>53 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Undetermined</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Christopher.png><p>Tish isn’t Billy’s first wife, he was once married to Cindy Smith when they divorced in 1991, he began dating Kristin Luckey and eventually had a son with her before he got married to Tish.</p><p>Born a few months before Miley on the 8th of April 1992, Christopher is the son of Kristin Lucky and Billy Ray Cyrus. Unlike his siblings, much isn’t known about Cody Cyrus as he has generally avoided the limelight.</p><p>Nevertheless, it has been reported in some quarters that he is a big fan of his sister Miley, although they have only met a few times and are miles and worlds apart.</p><p>His father’s fame didn’t rub off on him probably because of how Billy’s relationship with Kristin ended. When Cody was born, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Billy claimed he had a great relationship with his mom</a>, that they are friends and respect each other.</p><p>But then, Kristin would disclose that she only got to learn from a TV interview Billy had that he was expecting a child with Tish and that they were going to get married.</p><p>According to some reports, Cody has a shaky relationship with his father and seems to be closer to Miley, among his half-siblings. He <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>once described her as someone who is not self-obsessed</a> while he subtly suggested that she is the only one among the Cyrus family that has genuinely shown interest in knowing what goes on in his life.</p><p>Cody was notably excluded from a reality show that revolved around the Cyrus family. We are yet to confirm what he does for a living but some reports claim he is a litigation associate.</p><p>If one must believe that, then it is necessary to add that he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government from the University of Texas at Austin, after which he obtained his Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law.</p><h2><strong>The Wrecking Ball Singer Has Two Maternal Half Siblings</strong></h2><p>Tish was once in a band and that’s how she got to meet Billy. Before they got married in 1993, Tish was Baxter Neal Helson’s wife and they had two kids together named Brandi and Trace Cyrus.</p><p>They respectively became Miley Cyrus’ maternal half sister and brother when Tish gave birth to Miley in 1992. Brandi and Trace were later adopted by Billy and that’s why they bear his last name.</p><h3><strong>Brandi Cyrus</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:&nbsp;</strong>Brandi Glen Cyrus</li><li><strong>Biological Father:&nbsp;</strong>Baxter Neal Helson</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>May 26, 1986</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>37</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Actress, TV Host, Singer, and DJ</li></ul><p>Adopted by Billy, Brandi Cyrus shares the same biological father as Trace Cyrus. She was born on the 26th of May 1987 and is also a versatile entertainer like her younger, half-sister, Miley Cyrus.</p><p>Skilled in playing the guitar, she is one of the two members of Frank + Derol, a fairly popular pop duo. Although she regards herself as ‘the forgotten Cyrus child’, Brandi has toured with her father and sister. She also made a couple of appearances in Hannah Montana.</p><p>Brandi has been active in the entertainment industry since 1997. As an actress, her most recent project was in the TV series, The Queue. She featured in several episodes of the series in 2015, the same year she played Angel in Old 37. You will also find Brandi in Hannah Montana: The Movie and Zoey 101.</p><p>From what is obvious, Brandi and Miley have a good relationship and are very supportive of each other. They have been seen together in public several times.</p><p>One of their most notable public appearances was in 2013 when they met on the red carpet of the American Music Awards. Brandi, who was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>covering the event for Spin Media got to interview Miley</a> and it was a beautiful moment for their respective fans.</p><h3><strong>Trace Cyrus</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:&nbsp;</strong>Trace Dempsey Cyrus</li><li><strong>Birth Name:&nbsp;</strong>Neil Timothy Helson</li><li><strong>Biological Father:&nbsp;</strong>Baxter Neal Helson</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>February 24, 1989</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>34</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Musician</li></ul><p>Know for his many tattoos, Trace Cyrus was named Neil Timothy Helson after he was born on the 24th of February 1989. Like his sister Miley, Trace is also a musician. He’s known as a member of a band called Metro Station. Trace is very industrious; among other things, he owns a clothing company called ‘From Backseats to Bedrooms’.</p><p>He has been a professional musician since 2006; this was the year he co-wrote “Country Music Has the Blues,” a song that was part of Billy’s 2006 album titled&nbsp;Wanna Be Your Joe.&nbsp;</p><p>When Trace was much younger, he would tour and perform with Billy during his school holidays. Apart from Metro Station, he is also a member of a pop band called Ashland HIGH which he formed in 2010.</p><p>Trace is Tish’s first son with her ex-husband, Baxter Neal Helson, but was legally adopted by Billy. He is easily identified by his body art and piercings. The artist has run out of canvas; the tattoos are everywhere! As far as we can tell, the musician has a good relationship with his half-sister, Miley.</p><p>Although there is not much to tell in terms of works they have done together, the siblings are very fond of each other. This was made apparent when the Metro Station singer and Taylor Sanders called off their engagement in 2020. He took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram to appreciate Miley for being a supportive sister</a>.</p><h2><strong>Meet The Full Siblings of Miley Cyrus – Tish Is Their Biological Mother</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/billy-ray-tish-cyrus-divorce-ftr.jpg><p>You already know a lot about Leticia Jean “Tish” Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus from what we have discussed above. They are both entertainers and the parents of Miley Cyrus, the first child they had together. After her birth, the couple got married and subsequently had two more kids.</p><p>All of the kids they had together have been building their respective careers in the entertainment industry and this is hardly a surprise: afterall, an apple doesn’t fall far from its tree.</p><p>Tish and Billy are prominent figures in the entertainment industry. An actress, producer, and manager of Miley Cyrus, Tish is more reserved these days. Her most recent work as a producer is 2014’s <i>Miley Cyrus: Bangerz Tour.</i></p><p>As an actress, she was last seen in two episodes of <i>The Insider</i> in 2017. Her husband Billy is a successful singer-songwriter. He has been active since 1989 and has released 16 studio albums as of this writing.</p><p>Billy has been a part of many films and television shows, winning numerous awards and nominations for his efforts. With such a resume, it is only natural they are parents to Miley and her full siblings, Braison and Noah.</p><h3><strong>Braison Cyrus</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Braison Chance Cyrus</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>May 9, 1994</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>29</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Model, Actor, and Musician</li></ul><p>Born on the 9th of May 1994, Braison Cyrus is the only son that Tish and Billy had together. He is popular as a model having made his debut with Wilhelmina Models at the age of 18. He’s also a bit of an actor as he was a background character in Hannah Montana&nbsp;and would later attend the New York Film Academy.</p><p>He is also known for the role he played in the TV series,&nbsp;Doc,&nbsp;and the 2016 comedy film,&nbsp;Heels. Disregarding that, Braison has made several appearances on TV specials, video documentaries, and shows like The Simonetta Lein Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Miley Cyrus: Bangerz Tour, Billy Ray Cyrus: Home at Last, and much more.</p><p>Braison and Miley once dated siblings. The singer was in a relationship with Patrick Schwarzenegger and about a month later, it emerged that Braison was in a relationship with Catherine Schwarzenegger. Yeah, Miley and her brother dated Arnold Schwarzenegger’s children.</p><p>Braison is thus far the only sibling of Miley Cyrus that is married. He got married to Stella McBride in November 2019 and in December 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>they disclosed that they are expecting a baby boy</a>. This means that Miley Cyrus would soon become an aunt. Reacting to the news, the popular singer cum actress asserted that the baby would have the “coolest aunt on the block”.</p><p>As it is with the rest of her siblings, Miley has a good relationship with Braison. She <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>attended his wedding with Cody Simpson</a> in 2019 and took to Instagram to celebrate Braison after the event.</p><h3><strong>Noah Cyrus</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Noah Lindsey Cyrus</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>January 8, 2000</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>23</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Singer-Songwriter and Actress</li></ul><p>Noah is the youngest member of the fold, she was born to Billy and Tish on the 9th of January 2000. Being an actress, it is pretty obvious that she is following in her sister’s footsteps.</p><p>Noah has been making exploits right from her childhood; when she was 10, she created a children’s line of lingerie. As a singer, she received a Grammy Awards nomination in 2021 for Best New Artist. Earlier in 2017, Time&nbsp;magazine named her on its list of 30 Most Influential Teens.</p><p>Noah’s music career has seen her release three extended plays so far. In 2017, she opened for Katy Perry in her fourth concert tour titled Witness: The Tour. The following year, Noah headlined The Good Cry Tour; followed by The Not So Tour, Tour, in 2020.</p><p>The big-screen projects she has pulled off as an actress include Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, Mostly Ghostly, and Ponyo. She also made a cameo appearance as a dancer in 2009’s Hannah Montana: The Movie.</p><p>Noah has also been seen in multiple small-screen productions. Notably, she played Gracie Herbert in nine episodes of the medical drama series, Doc. She also played various recurring roles in six episodes of Hannah Montana and has portrayed characters in The Hugo & Rita Show, Take 2, and The Joey & Elisa Show.</p><p>Noah has a good relationship with her older sister, Miley, as they are clearly fond of each other. Nonetheless, she has admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>it’s difficult being Miley’s sister</a>.</p><h3><strong>Is Any Of Miley Cyrus Siblings More Famous Than She Is?</strong></h3><p>It is easy to see that Miley Cyrus is the most popular member of the Cyrus family. While her father is well known, Miley’s fame has eclipsed his popularity. Among her siblings, the only person that might get to attain Miley’s level of fame is Noah.</p><p>However, Noah has a very long way to go if she must equal Miley’s attainments in the industry. Given the fact that many people have concluded that she is only existing in Miley’s shadows, equalling Miley’s status as an entertainer hasn’t been made any easier for Noah.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC5yKWcsmWTrr%2B2v4ybqaismJq%2FtHnFmqSipKlk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthese-are-miley-cyrus-brothers-sisters-and-step-siblings-from-both-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthese-are-miley-cyrus-brothers-sisters-and-step-siblings-from-both-her-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthese-are-miley-cyrus-brothers-sisters-and-step-siblings-from-both-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthese-are-miley-cyrus-brothers-sisters-and-step-siblings-from-both-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthese-are-miley-cyrus-brothers-sisters-and-step-siblings-from-both-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthese-are-miley-cyrus-brothers-sisters-and-step-siblings-from-both-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-are-torrey-devitto-parents-biography-who-is-torrey-devitto-boyfriend-height-ethnicity-natio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-are-torrey-devitto-parents-biography-who-is-torrey-devitto-boyfriend-height-ethnicity-natio.html>Who Are Torrey Devitto Parents?
